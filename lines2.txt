That's horrible!
not awesome
i accidently tripped and kicked the table the 360 was sitting on
and i heard a scraping sound
oh god
That's depressing.
manly tears are allowed on that one
Yeah jimmy theirs tons of other chats
soi opened it up and there was a ring all the way around it near the middle
What?
No but really check it out
lol grocery
Nopers. That's called *advertising* and it's against the *rules*
I care?
does anyone know if the warrant will cover it?
How old is it?
the day after christmas
Probably.
probably not as it was your fault and a lot of places say that scratching is part of normal wear and tear
less than 1 month
oh
but you could take it somewhere to get resurfaced  &/ do that yourself
Jimmy im not advertising. im tellng you about a fcking quick way to get money
helps you and me
W00t!
well i got a little over 100 dollars coming my way sometime in this month
Got level 36 aced. XD

Hello all.
hey cj
hey cj
no i worked 7-11 last night and have to be here at 7am so i didn't get but like 4hours of sleep tops
sup cj
That's lame. :/
yeah but in the stupid recession at least i've got a job
true. That's a blessing.
lol crummy one but at least i'm not going all grapes of wrath up in here
:P
XD
eww.
God, I hope not anyways.
eww?
There were some NASTY things in that book
And I had to go with my class to see the play. :/
haha i only meant the poor living on the highway/traincar thing
Oh. XD
Well, if I found the poor repulsive, it would still be gross.
But I don't. :D
i hate like homeless obviously worthless wastes of space homeless
but i'm a jerk like that
Getting LitDude! You just completed the Getting Lit achievement in Pyro and won the Getting Lit badge and 5 points!View all badges.
this game is pretty cool
No, I totally understand. They just sit around and get paid, you have to work. XD
way to go snipe
lol jimmy
It is, I'm on level 39. It gets hard.
ty grocery
lol exactly i get paid a crummy wage and work weird hours and they do squat and get paid for it
totally unfair
People actually dress up as homeless to sit out on the street to get cash, and then their spouses come get them.
It's sickening.
And sad too
dude,  iwould ****ing stab someone if i saw that shit
0_0
...also pardon my angry asterisks
lol, I know, I was just lol-ing
XD
Congratulations! You've just completed the Year of the Fire Challenge! You have earned a card from our collectible card game.
whats worse is some of those people are making up to 100K a year begging
I know. yet still, they end up homeles..
*homeless
and this right here is why i hate the homeless and generally want them to freeze to death at night.
XD
I do have pity for those who don't have a home because of natural disasters
well look at it this way go beg for a few years and then buy yourself a house our rite and still have enough stashed away to live with
or i could just become a vigilante homeless murderer
and stalk idiots who give them money
:/
now that'd be an interesting
I don't feed the homeless though.
Maybe through charity, but not personally. lol
lol on 12
So I'd be safe!
i got an aced but one wasnt lit
i usually tell them to get a job and get the hell away though my city isn't very large and i'm almost never downtown so i don't see them

shadow how'd you beat level 35? :O

lol
what game do you play??
the levels arent hard, its getting an ace on them thats the problem
Ohhh um i gtg peace out hoes heh =)
level 35 is impossible to ace...
obviously its not if you can ace all 44
yeah
it is tough
WHat gam??
pyro
game
prae it's an impossible badge
so?
so the owner made it so no one would get it
uh, i have every other impossible badge
and the people who do probably cheat...
its possible, just difficult
woot
38
well, tell me when you ace level 35...
oh wait
lol
that's stupid
you ace it after 2 fire balls?
to get an ace, you just need to light the torches with one fireball
on 35 apparently you can use 2
if you burn the wood with the first, but light all the torches with the second, it is an ace
ohh
btw, i had aced 35 too :)
yeah

that way its pretty easy
you only just figured that out? what were you trying before?
umm...
well, not much really
lol
just sending out lone squires and stuff
then getting owned mega quick
i hate the squires, they're useless
I use dwarves
i've completed 11 lvls without a loss :)
arrow upgrades are very nice
i tend to use the guys on horses, or the catapults
yup, cannons + wizards (they have a very good range) are what i am mainly using
dwarves
whew
thank god for autofire, or id have RSI right now
Hi everyone
hihell
lol. yh, i can imagine
Happy 2nd day of January =]
lol
damn
they have catapiults
a few arrows will kill them
oh yes
thx
mwuhahahahaha
ill send out my own catapult
good idea, they're quite useful
it looks...wrong.....
its like a ghost
noones steering it
lol. that makes it stronger, surely. otherwise killing the weak person would stop it moving anywhere
damn
so close to a win there
right at their castle, then died
died? how come?
attacking castle, yes!
go knights!
as in, my man died
and, I won, easy as pie
simple when you know ho w really, isn't it?
ish
that was only lvl 5
I am quite bad
practice makes perfect
are wizards any good?
don't know, never used them
wizards are good to swarm
yes, get loads, they have a longer range than the cannons
ok, thats my main strategy
only thing ive had a problem with wizrds is orcs when the get the guys on the horses with axes
hey all
bombers are shit
yhea
pardon my french
lol
wizards are best
i use them only and a dragon or a angel arch
0.0
i just started playing with elves the phantom archers are really good
orcs are hard

totems
are they on lvl 6?
dunno
wait?
are they those things which blast stuff up into the air?
yes
ah
wow paladin....

the paladins are great
they just dont die!
all he archers cant do it
u need a warrior unit in front
i have a trebuchet killing them
that ok too
but try use warrior front
then the archers will kill the unit that fight them
noooo
paladins dead

lol
man i hate those stupid little orcs with the axes
sh*t
wizards are good
yrp
yep*
what do clerics do?
i dunno too

u sure?
not really worth it tho
wow
my clerics in front
yhea they only do a little bit tho
how much they heal?
totem, totem!!!!!!!!!!!!
they dont heal much there only good if yuo have em max and you make like 10 of em

Snipe!
So tired...but cant sleep
I know the feeling.
Welp, looks like i'll be living off of caffeine today
try red bull or relentless
and then lucozade alert
it works
bye
Or just get up and be active. That works too.
Sitting there, staring at the monitor induces drowsiness.
lies
That true, watching TV helps me sleep. The bright screen makes my eyes feel tired quicker
watch it in the dark
I can't get number 11 in Piro.
It is impossible =[
Yes, a dark room really helps in staying awake...
*shakes head*
Lol
how do u unlock spec level D?
in piro
Also, i havn't eaten yet. That usually helps wake me up
So go eat!
I was about to >.>
My spam mail brings a smile to my face.
Heh, whys that?
People sending me letters saying I need their pills to spice up my sex life.
Haha
Or the ones saying I've won money.
you need more than that. ;)
That reminds me of an Applegeeks...i must find it!
I particurily like the ones saying I've won a free laptop or something like that.
Like, when did I fill that form out?
http://applegeeks.com/comics/viewcomic.php?issue=11
zomg applegeeks
yay i go past lvl 11
Yeah.
Level 11 was tricky.
argh... 13
You know, i have no idea why i keep buying hats...i hate wearing things on my head
lol
Just like collecting them?
I guess, or maybe i just like knowing i have plenty if i need one
Do you hang them up on your walls?
I just keep them in my closet
They usually dont see the light of day after i buy them
Bleh.
Now to figure out how to ace the other 17 levels...
hi
hi
knux

*sniff*
*de-materializes so the fireball passes through*
... *chucks a ghostly fireball at Duckie*
I had NO idea what this thing did
>.>
but apparently it keeps track of your active windows =D
A ghostly fireball?
I have something like that too mck
Its called "Task Manager"
lol
And tracks the data
Yeah, Task Manager does that, right?
Under the Performance tab?
No it doesn't
Yeah, it think it does
http://wakoopa.com/Hawk-McKain
Have you seen pie charts in Task Manager?
Nope.
Stop advertising mck!

I never felt that my Task Manager was missing a pie chart.
It also tracks web page usage ^^
I was half expecting McKain to have iPal do it... xD
I never really liked pie charts
Line graphs ftw
Why would I make him spam? =o
He can be silenced
Oh, come to think of it...
CC....
I'm not talking to you
!lastseen PurpleAlex
Knux, I saw PurpleAlex 1 day and 20 hours ago
Whoa
I know, i was just having a monologue....
lol
No, I meawn I'm going to ignore you, because you're being stupid
When was last time Alex was MIA for 2 full days? xD
!lastseen the greatest person ever, oh wait it is you
There was a problem with your command (lastseen) Sorry!
aww
Every good villains knows that you need to monologue
=D
Yes!
That reminds me of The Incredibles.
That is what i was thinking of
wtf
Syndrome, right?
Yeah, they make fun of super villains monologing a ton in that movie
gtg guys, stuff to do. see ya later
I love the part when he goes off on his car.
Hah
Slamming the door then picks it up to toss it.
And the little kid on the tricycle sees him
Then he sees that kid, set the car down and runs inside.
Lol, yes!
lol
I'm in the mood to pop some popcorn and watch that movie now.
Heh
lol
love that film
WTF
99 bricks has new soundtrack
oh wait, nvm
I see a few levels in this that shouldn't be Ace-able....
that wasnt 99 bricks
knux 32 is
It's all about the precise angle and velocity, Knuckles.
Yeah, but Duckie, there are levels, like 33, that you need to use the first fireball to get a torch and another fireball that can actually reach the other torch
*shrugs*
9 is do-able with one, but not 33...
Because 33 has an extra fireball that can fit into places the normal fireball can't, which is what you need to get the other torch.
You know, I love Damijin but he should have made a better game =[
how many aces do i have to get for bonus d?
26
27
whoo boy i only have 18 ;'(
Was it 27?
Why do local comercials always sound like they are from the 70's...
Eh, all commercials suck.
Training DayDude! You just completed the Training Day achievement in Tactical Assassin 2 and won the Training Day badge and 5 points!View all badges.
Not true, those freecreditreport.com commercials sure are catchy
Well actually, the Victoria's Secret commercials I like.
Heh
Late night Girls Gone Wild commercials, Duckie? xD
Nah, that I can just watch on the internet.
nope i aced 33 knux XD
DUDEEEE.... My nephew told his mother he wants a mohawk because he wants to be 'more rock'. xD
Hah
At least he didn't say it was because he wanted to be like the Night Elf Mohawk.
XD
who?
hi
the Wow COMMERCIal with mr. T
Maybe Mr T is good with computers and hacked the game, ever think of that?
I doubt he is,.
Now Ozzy is in WoW commercials
saw that
I just can't picture him hunched over in front of a monitor, chugging back caffiene drinks and snacking on Pop-Tarts and Slim Jims.
was awful
lol
they [;ay that one way too much
I also saw ozzy in a commercial for a cell phone company
lol ghost ozzys got money , he'd be chuggin back mana potions
Yeah, that was an embarrassing commerical.
I didn't mean Ozzy, I meant Mr. T.
oh yeah
i think mr. t would be playing warhammer
Could you imagine him jumping up and smashing the monitor the first time he get head shotted?
we must drug his milk!
lol

CC, by the way... It was 'Slabs Of Ham, Cabbage And Horseradish, Tons Of Asparagus'
slice off his c*** and his tes******... ouch alot
No knux, i played the game over to see what it was and wrote it down
lol
even though alot is 2 words... wouldn't work otherwise
Its celery, not cabbage. Who eats cabbage on purpose? >.>
I do?
Cabbage and Ham = yummy.
Then again, i dont see how people can eat any vegatables on purpose
I really am beginning to hate Pyro
corned beef and cabbage.. every st pattys day
Yeah, CC, you can name anything that can be eaten, and someone probably eats it.
THis cant be good...
A rule 34 clone?
I have a big text document of Quotes on my iPod. Half of them are from TWEWY
If it exists it will be eaten?
xDD
lol
wow
my bro just got my wii online
Hmmm, i need to put the laws of anime on my iPod

Oooh!
According to facebook, my superpower would be MemoryManipulation
Add a space in there...
Ed just came to bother me again... xD
~blah i have to afk.... errand run...
Have fun. ^^;
Huh...
I cant decide whether Memory Manipulation is awesome or lame
Awesome.
You could rob them then make them think it was someone else.
Oooh
That is good
Could be useful for sex, too. >.>
why rob them and blame somebody when you could just make them remember that they were going to give you everything they had in the firstplace ;)
... Duckie, you just got pretty severely outsmarted.
Yep.
:/  didn't mean to come off as a dick.  sry
Well, you did!
You didn't. xD
:(
it's a gift I guess...
hehe
Im regretting reseting my ability
Yes! Aced!
That idea was actually pretty good, though.
I traded in Memory Manipulation for...HEALING!?
Loser.
awwww fail!
Way to be Altruistic, CC
Meh, i can reset it again tomorrow
I'm proud of you
I was hoping for something more sinister like being able to kill a yak from 200 yards away...with mind bullets!
lol
Oh, you want to do that?
You should get BORDERLANDS
>.>
I havn't heard mck rant about borderlands for awhile
They have no webpage still =[
I'M WORRIED

Crap
I just picked a fight with a guy that can see the future
Oh! I know! I'll just HEAL him to death!
>.>
XD
Make him a zombie first? xD
Molecular Manipulation! THATS the power i want!
Like Molecule Man?
Heh
Supposedly one of the most powerful villains in Marvel.
He's the one that dropped an entire mountain range on a group of superheroes during the Secret Wars.
How is a war secret? O.o
The secret was the reason for it, who was behind it.
Oh
Duh!
Read more comic books.
Heh
O____O
an entire mountain range?
wow.
That really doesn't sound so secret
You don't need molecular manipulation to do that
I didn't say you do.
There isn't much else that would let you do that
just faith as big as a grain of a mustard seed
That was just an example of his powers.
ha, Squeak
Hahah
or, you know, Yoda
Yoda was a wuss.
Actually, healing isnt bad. It's almost impossible for me to die
If al you can do is heal yourself, the fight will never end.
*all
Well,i can punch them too >.>
Ahh.

Fights would sort of depend on who ran out of energy first
Draw them into some DoT hazard?
hey every1
hey Alex
RO-BOT! Huuumaaannn

Augh. I gotta skip this level for now. I can't get the angle right for the ace because it doesn't have a decent focal point.
Yes Man!
Haha, that looks like it'll be hilarious.

Rock! Robot Rock!
*ahem*

I think it's hilarious that so many people think his "Dare to be Stupid" is an actual Devo song.
Why do we cook bacon, and bake cookies?
Just to bug you.

For the same reasons we park in a driveway and drive on the parkway.

So there is a woman out there just constantly repeating "That"
Congratulations! You've just completed the Year of the Fire Challenge! You have earned a card from our collectible card game.
Here's an interesting fact. The most commonly used phrase in the history of movies is "Let's get out of here."
"Like now"?
Everyone needs to be aware, according to the Lake Superior State University banned words list for 2009, we can no longer use <3
Use what?!
So if anyone here ever directs an action movie, make them say 'Let's get---' 'Shut up.'
*panic attack*
hah, ironically, Kongregate doesn't show it
the "Less than three" heart symbol
Yeah, Kong fails.

I think you should lay down for a bit
I've still been here, I just don't talk. I listen to the chat, read up on everyone.

High level fireballs are fun =D
thats y when someone says "kiss my ass" i say "with or without tounge"
Yeah, moving on, Bob
lol
~=.=;;
I must say, the survivors add a nice element to the game
_|
So you can't just get uber powerful and nuke the map all the time
McKain, you do realize that Apocalypse is in the lightning tree, right?
what happenes when u kill 1?
So?
That's gotta be the greatest ability ever.
You lose the "Saved all survivors" bonus
Nuking the map?
It's called Apocalypse for a reason. No one is supposed to survive.
I would just nuke them all.
I want the AP =p
im iron man :D
*takes bob's name* im still bob
Bobs your uncle?
McKain, you get some AP for killing them.
brb
~I wanna play Kagome Kagome...

oh, Minefield maxes out at 25 mines
I wish it would show you the level
Okay, I'm now at 41 on flare, assuming either 50, 100, or none.
:( survivor stepped on mine
Awesome.
Did he explode in a mist of red?
Unless it just stopped upgrading and I didn't notice.
Or body parts go flying?
lol
idk
no, it wouldn't stop upgrading
It's only at 2.00 damage.
!!!
Unknown command, try !help
damn

I love this game ^^

I like the music to this game.
i muted it to listen to disturbed

Whack Your Boss.
OOH, I've played this before!
This is a fun game.
Lol, I think I like the one where he beats the shit out of him then slams him through the wall.
I think the water cooler is my favorite.
Haven't done that one yet.
Lol! Drowns him.
Oh ho! The chair is awesome!
Nice, death by pencil.
why do the comments say whack your boss is stolen?
It probably is.
Some people steal games from other sites and post them here without permission.
Yay, all 17 ways to whack your boss.
When I first played this, it took me forever to find the last one... the coat hook
My last one was his hands.
I still think the wall is the best one though.
the walls nice cause there are co-workers screaming
Yep.
The scisors one was awesome
Lol, yeah.
scisors are short though
Bloody outline.
i like the drawer
Lol, yeah. That's a good one.
The almost peaceful look he gets on his face.
I soo wish I could have gotten away with this crap when I was working.
did someone say there was a pencil ?
yeah, the boss' pencil
ahhh
i won! sweet
in his dreams
brb
lol. I loaded pyro and immediately got the card and easy badge
Oh, hey guys!!
Anyone have played Pyro?
same here future
space bugs should have an auto fire
if someone else played with the game on your computer, then that is obvious
makes me not want to play it
pyro yeah, its alright, not great, but a quicky
its boring.
Pyro? Yeah, it gets old.
Ya...
No!!
YAY! I fixed my speakers!
Yay!
Good job Jeni!
Let me guess. You plugged them in?
TY
Lol
No, they were plugged in already

The first one was a lot of fun

Protector II was ridiculously hard
~Paved?
~but didn't have enough cash to support the amount of mages i needed
heh
~Oh! That game.
Good job
~Eh. Gets old.
At least you have that wave indicator
~*has 20 empty spaces*
~Basically a TD game.
I beat it when there was no wave indicator
~brb
yarrr i be back ye scurvy dogs
Meaning when the Poison Rat wave came out of no where I died
~Yay~
Granted, figuring out the mixture for that level takes a while anyway
but that's not the point
procector tends to just piss me off
not really a fan
~Yeah, I'm not a fan of those type of games either.
~I play them long enough to snag a badge or two then bail.
i actually really dig td type games, that one just puts me in a stabbin mood
~ok i think i messed up...
~Heh.
what'd you did?
~i have 27 fire mages
O__o
wtf
~and there's a fire resistant boss who keeps going through my maze
~XD
Good job
~and it has regen
~Haha.
best buy you another kind of mage
~yay i beat it!
~You have to mix it up.
~*it took 7 lives*
~Fire, ice, posion, etc...
The stupid curve ball bosses you have to account for is probably the thing I hate most
That and the levels have too much unused floor path space which drives me batty
~*sigh* 10 more waves =.=
~40 fire mages
~Waste.
~*listens to Sister Hazel*
~im dead
~fire absorbing wave...
~Yep. You need to mix it up next time.
specialist or generalist?
~Depends.
they rock
Fire Specialist = AoE damage
Poison SPecialist = Poisioning.... etc
Read the Proteopedia =o
~k
~cause i go specialist first, then 5 levels of generalist to raise their range
When I beocme rich and famous I'm buying a Pocky factory

If so, I must join it.
~You've already got the purple boa...
Indeed.
~I thought it was pink?
Eh
Purple and black.
I fell asleep =(
~Ahh.
So tired
This game is a little too easy on Easy. I'm not actually having to do anything.
Hey hyphyboy
how r things
hey cranky
Cranky u still deppresed
~CLEAR! *hits room with defib paddles*
*convulses*
~It's ALIVE!
YaY
Grraaaaaaaaaaaaar
~... sorta...
_?
yeah well what can ya do
~ I hate tildes...
lol
~hehe, then why are you using them?
Though Tilde would be a decent band name
~wha...?
Only for an experimental Icelandic grammar-rock band.
~I hate british people.
lol
The feeling is mututal.
~Well, except you, Pam.
Matilde?
OH
^_^
That explains why "Katrine" is pronounced "Katrina"
o god my side hurts like crazy
Er... well...
Room died again? ;o
hi
Could be an experimental australian grammar-rock band. Waltzing ma-tilde-ah?
How many Australian bands have you heard of? Yeah, exactly.
not alot
i have to admit it would be intresting to hear though
~wiggly baby
The Wiggly Babies?
???
no i think she meant the ~
~No, I'm tryin to hold the baby, but he's uber wiggly
Overwiggly?
Now that would be a good name for a band.
~yes
mmmmmkay
of course
maybe i should just stop talking :/
dunno
~ok, so....   Who likes icecream?
Everyone!
Except nazis.
But they're nazis, so they don't get ice-cream anyway.
No, they're Nazis so they horde it all
but never eat it
You can't horde ice-cream very well.
You'd need a large freezer.
Or a very cold place.
~ Why are Nazi's mentioned in this room almost daily?
Godwin's law?
dunno
~ What is Godwin's law?
As an internet discussion continues, the probability of Hitler or the Nazis being mentioned rapidly approaches 1.
Aoi copycat
jeni
lol
hey cranky wats up
~I think someone gave my baby crack
!
Unknown command, try !help

~he won't sit still
Duct tape?
my little brother does that
~brb
~Duck tape?
Going to lseepy
Bye all
Duckie, you can't use duck tape, it's made out of your brethren.
I can actually.
AHA
No ~
~Oh, wow. I slipped once.
~I got a bowl of Ramen noodles distracting me.
Clearly on a subconscious level you don't want to use it
Were you traumatised by a tilde as a child?
~It's a different brand though.  :(
~ im starting squiggly right now
~I'm used to Nissen and this is Maruchan.
~im used to japanese imported :]
they are the best
Like a supermarket-brand Pot Noodle?
~it's all nasty crap
yes
It's food.
~Blasphemy, Fuego.
yeah
~No, Patito, if you ate that crap every day for a couple years, you'd think it was nasty too.
~not that I can ever eat it again... but still
~I did eat it everyday when I lived in Montana because it was all I could afford.
~yup.  I ate that crap a lot growin up, but since then I've become allergic to onions, and can not eat it now.
thats stinks
gotta catch on to squggly
~meh. You get used to it after a while. It just means I have to cook everything myself.  I don't go out and eat, I can't buy prepackaged foods, I have to read the ingrediant pannel on EVERYTHING... yadda yadda yadda
~Hmm, this actually isn't bad. I just have to remember not to use so much water next time.
~I remember we used to put egg in it too, that wa sok
~was o k*
~Mix an egg in with the noodles? Never heard of that.
~Did you cook the egg first then just scramble it in?
~Yup, just throw a raw egg in and cook it, the egg will cook with it.
~Hmm.
~pretty good stuff
~well, scramble it up a bit first, otherwise you'll have a massive rubbery egg in there...
~I just add water and toss it in the microwave. I don't think an egg will cook in there.
~It sure will
~Try it sometime... Scramble an egg, put it in a bowl and cook for two minutes... I don't suggest eating it, as it will be rubbery, but it will cook.
~If you mix it with the noodles and water though, it's not rubbery.
~Adds flavor or what?
~Yeah, a little.
~I might have to try that.
phew finally axed 20 ^^
~It's not much, but it adds a little to it.
cool
What's all this?
~all this what?
~Maybe he means all that.
~what i started?
I left this on, while I sleep.. and then I think I saw something about cooking before I refresh..
~It's all Aoi's fault.
~Or mine.
~i thought it was duckies fault
~*shrugs*
~We'll just blame it all on Duckie...
kk
~yeah
haha
OK
im having my own style
cant decide
duckie, is this ~ thing all your faulst?
~of curse it is.  Who else would do such a thing?

I'm at 2 bucks a cup on this Lemonade game.
~I'm at 5, it doesn't get any higher than this.
Nicely done.
Lemonade stand?
~Nam, did you read the instructions... if not, do so now please.
It's because of you that I started playing this game.
~The instructions below the game I mean.
~wow... so the ~ mark is still around ^.^
~It's Duckie's fault.
~i didn't see it for awhile...
Which instructions, Jeni?
brb
~Well, I'm afk watching a movie.
Oh, yes, I read them.
~ah, k
~The ones below the game..
Interesting application.
~Somethimg about pirates and stuff.
Yep. Almost like they meant it for another game.
Bussiness game...
Business*
Jeni, does the icebox actually increase your max ice?
Doesn't let your ice melt in the end of the turn
~I dunno, it won't let me buy one, but I have 1000 max ice at the moment.
As I remembered from a similar game..
Well, it doesn't do anything for capacity.
Time to save up another 2.5k.
It doesn't even load -_-
I'm currently playing it..
That game was a fun game
Business Game, always fun..
lol
Why doesn't it load... I've refreshed a couple times already..
hey kain
I love the music during the fight between Cloud and Sephiroth.
Are you watching Advent Children?
~????
Yes.
it loads for me
That's One Winged Angel. Sephiroth's song.
Yeah. I have it in a mp3.
~no more `, Duckie?
Eh.
~it's funny how when you translate it, it sounds pretty wrong...
~~*
Trasnlate what?
Er, translate
~One Winged Angel
Oh.
That song contains latin..
Jeni, have you done any advertising?
Finally it loads...
~nah it's a waste of money
And is there a point to the first cart upgrade?
~it allows you to hold more stuff
Oh. I didn't know that.
I just saved for the first permanent stand.
1500 ice! Heck yes.
gratz
!!!!
Unknown command, try !help
lol

This Lemonade Millionaire game is not that good
There's no graphics..
Sure there are
unless it's a text based game
~you might have to refresh it
No, if you've played Lemonade Tycoon you'll know which is better
desktop tower defence is fun
Obciously a game application is going to be better then almost any flash/java game.
~hehe, that's what Burnme's playin right now.. Lemonade Tycoon Deluxe
Now Lemonade Tycoon is better than this online version, I've seen some other lemonade tycoon online is better than this
I think FOG got their description messed up
~Just a little bit.
~It's close though... pirates/lemonade ...
~it's all the same
I agree, I hear lemonade, my mind jumps right to piracy.
omg its 8 :D
~and...???
ight everyone
~night snipe
~TERR~
nighters.
ok, it's not a bad version of the game
Super Lemon Stand is my last upgrade.

hey kered
hi
Ok, the site isn't geared towards any specific age group.   You must be 13 to have an account according to TOS, but there isn't an age limit and it's not geared towards any age...  I know several people on this site who are at least 10 years older
than I am and I bet I'm 10 years older than most of you.
._.
*I know that was a late reply, but I was bathing my four month old*
ok.....
Okay, A, didn't know that, thanks for the info, Jeni. 2, If you're 31, I'm impressed by the lack of hatred in your typing
I'm not that old yet... O.O
Thought so. So you're not 10 years older than me
I didn't say you specifically
I know.
....
26?
Better.
I think it's on my profile...
maybe
To be honest, you don't act that old, but you did say you had at least two kids.
sounds 24
._.
Wait...
I have three, a six year old *well, she'll be six on the 8th* a two year old and a four month old.
Four kids or three?
Ohhh
Musta misread dat.
did u go to college?
cuz now i yhink 28
think i mean
I started college, but then had my first daughter and decided to put it on hold until after I have raised my kids.
25, she is, jackass.
)
lol
And my friend Rose is 26 with four kids.
10 years older yup
Going to College ATM
ATM?
at the moment
aahh, I thought you were naming the college... heh
At the Moment being currently, but I didn't feel like spelling it
*blonde moment*
lol
Can only be claimed if you are!
I'm not
I tried to go blonde once, but since I have red hair, the blonde dye turned it orange and yellow and funky colors.
Blonde by Proxy moment, then. Since there are plenty without the intellect around.
Naturally red with Green Eyes?
Naturally red, with blue eyes
There's no such thing as natural black hair
Huh. Never thought of that hair/eye combo. Sounds pretty.
*is reminded of the movie Big Trouble in Little China*
It's Dark Dark Brown..
Mine?

Mine

What do you mean WTF?
*agrivated* I don't know how many Aces I need to get to get the last level unlocked
~LOL McK!
I mean why is Amazon passing that off as 99% off a 3,800$ 80gb laptop harddrive XD
26 or 27
It isn't? ^.^; *computer unsavvy*
No, it is
Buy now and get 99% off today!
But it's the fact it started at 3,800 bucks XD
Because Viewers are Morons.
It's true
That's the only reasoning that makes sense, sadly.
Oh my, I havn't been on DA in so long, I have 49 unread messages...
hi road scholars
what's up?
Psh
Hi merl
49 is nothing
49 really is nothing
and mine bottoms out at 36
Well considering I have no friends on DA, nor have I ever given anyone my name on DA...
~how many do i have...
I can confirm you need 27 aces to get to D... just got there. :)
~70 messages...
I've had 8 hour periods with 50 missed deviatations, 10 journals, 5 comments and 1 reply
DA, stands for what again? too many initials today
Damn Artists.
.... I meant Deviant ARt.
~Deviantart
~lol
oh, ok...i think i have an account, but i never actually scan my stuff
i've heard of deviant art
some girl nerd in my skool goe's on it lol
apparently I created my account in Oct of 07 and havn't been back since...
Was that English?
I suppose 49 messages is nothing in that time frame.
....
Dang Jeni
that's barely anything
u heard of sender13
Do you have anyone watched?
nope
my friend went away for a few weeks and had a few hundred messages when she got back.  all watches and such, but still
Subversion then. That's all Deviant Art upgrades and shit. So yeah.
Yup
What sort of Art do you produce?
Poetry
Beautiful. No pun intended.
*if* you call that art.
I do
haha... Merl... is my poetry 'beautiful'?
XD
http://www.blombotales.com/view/28
It's normally pretty raunchy
lmao
Lovely
although I havn't yet posted any on DA
Just myspace and livejournal
*sneezesneeze* Allerges....

Congratulations! You've just completed the Smatch Ya Later Kongregater! You have earned a card from our collectible card game
......
yeah.....
Ooooh, new challenge day. BRB!
kitty , what day is it.....
april first.....
xD
Last year's April Fool was much better
My dad gave me blue milk.
eww
WhT?
There's an april fools?
For breakfast.
yeah, here in sweden one tiny hamburger costs like 17 euro
xD
hello
I thought the interest I got on my ISA this morning was an April Fool. Then I remembered the recession =\
I win. :D
well done :P
has anyone ever heard of 3oh!3's song don't trust me?
(also, hullo scholars)
nope
And hello =p
No, sorry.
Mom said culinary school requires atleast a year of meat preperation, and...
You have to EAT atleast a bite of what you make.
wth
yeah..
You can't be a good chef if you can't eat the food you make
dear god you people must look it up
*sigh*
it woke me up this morning and i didn't even know wtf was happening
I was planning on looking for one with a culinary course meant for vegan/vegetarian/specialty cooks, ya know?
hmm, I'd say you'd be lucky to find one
Congratulations! You've just completed the Smatch Ya Later Kongregater! You have earned a card from our collectible card game
You usually need a good grounding in general cooking before you specialise
is THAT na april fool's day joke?
kate you finally decide to be come a chef?
Possibly, Fiend.
I already do alot of specialty cookin already anyway, Dan.
yeah, true, but not with qualifications
I'm talking about actually becoming certified
I wanna work at Spiral Diner. :3
I know, Dan.
Ello few.
Eyy Anna
2009-04-01 15:22:09 WalkingxSpazztic: :3*
Spiral Diner is a smallish vegan resturaunt.
Last I heard, there's one in Dallas and one in Fort Worth. We went there once or twice on a vacation. :3
kate do you live in a big city or a smaller place?
'Burbs.
I hope it's well-advertised that it's Vegan
Like BIG neon signs
I'd hate to get in there,sit down, open the menu and not see any nice food =p
Pretty well. It's very good food, too.
We weren't vegetarian at the time, I think.
I'd get straight back up and walk out xD
Oh wait.... No, I prolly was. But meh.
*shrug* I liked vegan food before I went veggie. xD
lol
Some vegetarian food is nice
But in a restuarant, I'd only ever have either starter or main vegetarian, the other would need meat
But vegan food, can't really think of anything I'd like
....
Potato chips are vegan.
And fries
I'm talking about meals though =p
My brain is NOT working properly
hehe :D
*is thinking*
Rattatoie? *doesn't know how to spell*
Me either, but it's not spelled like that :D But to me, that's an accompaniment, not a meal
I really can't think, but I promise there are good ones.
lol, fair enough :p
So dizzy... x.x
=(
*shrug*
I managed to do my schoolwork.
Heh, well that's alrite then =p
I've gone from review foive to chapter 7, part 4. xD
*five
WOOT
In math, I mean.
I absolutely hate math. xD
I have no idea what that means, but well done? :p
Though, in all fairness, my brother probably could have done most of chapter 6....
Well, not the youngest, but still. xD
It was a revision on arithmetic. It wanted me, literally, to write 12 in words. xD
interesting =p
I'm only not skipping chapter 7 because my previous book failed to teach me how to measure spheres. >.>
Haven't looked at chapter 8 yet
what...the... ... IS THIS GAME????
What?
all I did was hold my mouse button down and make swirly motions for how ever long the time limit was, and I got the card...
I know. xD

March 31st, 2009 11:59:59 pm
It's not a joke!
bb
I did
What?
as in, be back
but I think they only do it for popular videos
Google made Chrome in 3D with cut-out 3D glasses
youtube is upside down
xD
You get a 3D button which makes websites look stereoscopic
But obviously the glasses just have opaque blue and red lenses :p
Its every video on youtube
.... I need a new game.
And I don't have Chrome:(
Over COntruction!
What type of games do you like?
Puzzles. :D
But I've gone through the first 25ish pages of the puzzle thing
New! Automatic Red-Eye Addition
XD
So you have played Loops of Zen?
Google also introduced CADIE - some neural networked global PC that will transform the internet, at the bottom, you get a link to a "new, more functional google homepage, created by CADIE" and it's like a myspace page covered in Pandas
Yup

Well, my brothers did once, on accident. 0o
*scrathes kittys ears*
yo pa
Hey PA
Evening all.
Hey]
BURN DOWN BABYLON
...sorry
what, no puuring?
PA, my main man, how's it hangin' in the streetz bro?
My throat hurts.
bk
what haz babylon done?
It's the G20. My lefty Tourette's has kicked in
aww
im gonna be on here off and on, gotta do research for a paper which has an awesome topic
SMASH THE SYSTEM
...sorry
What tourrets?
*makes kitty some hot chocolate and lets her sip it from a spoon*
Ahhh
In other words, the number of twats in the city quadrupled for the day
Now now, Dan
The police are just trying to do their jobs
*sips* Nommy. :3
hm, hf alexis
hey, micha, is there a map of all the wormholes/hidden stuff on flashtrek?
ehh
i think there only are 2 wormholes
lol PA
i know ones on bajora
SHIT
where's the other one?
the one on bajora and on kardon
I do try and be reasonable.
I have to take my brothers kite flying, brb
err
But my mum's an old leftist
kardon or harman
ite
ty
And I've heard the horror stories about the SPG
k
But in all honesty, most of the people in the crowds were twats
So riot police bring out my latent ACABness.
I disagree, Dan.
I think there was a determined minority on both sides who were out to cause trouble.
But by and large the protestors were there for legitimate reasons
True, I don't argue with that, and I'm sure the violence/disorder/vandalism/theft was due to a relatively small number of people
I want an Intuos 4!
If I didn't have agoraphobia and beinghitintheheadwithabatonphobia, I'd have been there too.
I just see protesting in that manner as a bit twattish
O___O
I see what's happened to our economy as being a bit twattish.
Solves nothing, and only alientes those people sitting at home watching it on TV
alienates*
The Intous4 has those tiny LED displays by the express keys
...awesome
theres tri achnid at kong
where in kardon, micha?
Maybe so, but people are going to be angry.
And protest is a right.
ehh
in the lower right
And yes, that's true also. But I bet 99% of the people in that crowd have ZERO idea of who/what caused the problems with the economy
ty
I mean, you see the photos of the lines of riot cops in front of the RBS building, and you think, is that really what you want to be protecting?
And will just shout slogans against Madoff or whoever
Well, that is their right also.
Well, as my Dad works there, yes =p
People are allowed to be stupid about politics.
People should be allowed to be stupid about politics. And other people should be allowed to taser the former group
exactly, the politicians are the perfect example of this right
hey, so lower right, you say, micha?
...im never going to get this card...
All very well to laugh at it, if you don't know what real police repression is like.
I didn't mention police
I'd rather the police tasered people than civilians.
And I'd rather the police didn't taser people at all.
I'm talking about normal, level-headed citizens who are fed up with the ignorant masses blaming whoever the media puts a lser designator on that particular day
I like the old tasers with the single good charge. You expel that, then taser your own tongue for a while with the residue. Good fun.
But you're blaming the protestors on the basis of the media misrepresenting them.
Is that not ironic?
I care little about the media's portrayal of them
I've seen it first hand
(not on this occassion, granted, but my Dad did, and I trust hime as a source)
But can you not see why people are so angry?
peaceful or otherwise, the vast, vast majority of the people protesting today either didn't know who they were protesting against/what they were protesting against/were protesting against the wrong people
Media or no, they have good reason to be.
kkk  sucks
mao
im a t butur fat
They felt the need to get on the streets and protest. To me, that signifies a greater level of interest in politics than most people.
Yes, I can. But I also think it's stupid to take that anger out on undeserving parties. That makes you worse than anyone you may be protesting against
Define 'undeserving', though.
fdnlgkfnvkndvfkjkjndfnfjfdns
jd, stop spamming random nonsense
Undeserving in the sense that the blame laid on them is totally unjustified, poorly researched, and stinks to high heaven of a scapegoat culture in the media that is eaten up by the masses
But the people they're laying the blame on are still largely complicit in what they're angry about.
~hai guise!
And they're the most visible representation of it.
Of course they're going to take flak for it.
My history teacher made a funny. e.e
Hey Anna, Aoi.
Hi Alex.
hey spazz
Hi Curu
*glomps spaz*
*counter=glomps spazz*
I mean, I for one would be glad if everyone there could protest in an orderly fashion, and there was no need for the Met to unleash the TSG and such.
Well. Jon. When a boy economy and a girl economy...
o0
Perhaps (in the case of RBS here), there are people within the company at fault. But most of the people working there are just doing as they're told, trying to earn money, equally worried about the economic situation as those protesting outside
*Glomp'd twice and tries to fallhug both* @.@
XD
...wut?
(but actually doing some work rather than wasting time protesting)
~bleh... i have the stupidest luck...
boy echonomy and girl echonomy?
I fail to see how exercising one's democratic right to air grievances is a waste of time.
*high fives spazz's teacher*
conomy*
..economy.
Maybe it's a more dangerous mentality to continue doing your job even if you think it's wrong.
What?
Because it changes nothing, and alienates people from your cause
I just confused myelf. x.x
Perhaps so, but I'm sure most employees of such places don't think that their job is wrong
It's an honest expression of discontent which in this age of spin and manafactured politics is immensely valuable.
And I'm also sure that a lot, if not most of the protestors would happily take a job at RBS if it meant economic safey for the next few years
I don't believe that's true.
You try getting an SWP activist into a suit.
Most of the protestors are just here because their own situation has taken a turn for the worse. Offer them a chance to change it, they'll take it. Other protestors are hardscore activists, and wouldn't
But they make up the minority in these things
call to arms?
But they see their chance to change it as protesting, surely?
spaz, what are oyu confused about then?
They're just angry and want to feel like they're doing something about it
A case of emotion over intelligence
Well, to some extent they are. They've made their voices heard, at the least.
hey spazz, i'm just ignoring all this debate/babble
They know deep down that the G20 leaders/RBS bosses will just close the blinds and ignore them
But it's not them they need or want to convince.
I mean, say you're a hardline socialist.
You're never going to convince Barack Obama or Gordon Brown of the validity of your position.
But we're not talking about hardline socialists, we're talking about regular people who've lost their jobs/savings/pensions
No, I'm using it as an example.
The hardliners make up the vast minority
ok, go ahead
so what've you been up to, spazz?
Well, if you're a hardliner, you're aiming to convince the general public, surely?
Of course
Well, haven't the protests then served their purpose?
But again, going back to the masses, I'm pretty sure there's no appetite for popular uprising in Britain
she left the room...
I still think they've had the opposite effect
oh
ite then
That depends on how smart you think the general public are.
People who are already hardliners/verging on it, will think it's great, and be inspired
Other people will see on TV a bunch of thugs smashing in the square mile and think "what a bunch of tossers"
If you give them credit enough to recognise that most protestors were non-violent, then yes, it will get them support.
Except maybe the chavs, who like that kind of thing
And it's easy to dismiss people as thugs, without thinking about why they might be doing what they're doing.
That goes for both sides.
Doesn't justify their actions, but we should attempt to understand the reasoning behind them.
breaking int a building and stealing computers is simple thuggery
And those are the images that will be seen time and time again from these protests
Those and the G20 leaders happily going about their business, with no protestors in sight
You'll forgive me if I don't hold a lot of sympathy for a multi-million pound company. The people who work there, sure. But the offices?
It's the principle
I agree with you.
But you can see why they were doing it.
"you're rich, so it doesn't matter if I vandalise/steal your property"
Where do you draw the line?
Same place I always have, the rule of law.
"you earn 10k a year more than me, I have every right to steal your car until everyone gets equal pay"
You're shadowboxing. I'm not suggesting what they did was right, or anything other than common criminality.
But by trivialising it, we fail to understand how things got to this point.
But you're lauding the fact that there is a "reason behind it" as a limiting factor to their culpability, or that's how it seems
Well, if it's a choice between a man smashing up a house where people actually live, and a man smashing up an empty office, then yes, I consider him marginally less culpable.
hmm, there were 188 people in this room when we began, there's 151 now....reckon it's our fault? :D
Doesn't mean that man doesn't deserve to be punished.
=D We've driven everyone else away
148
Shall we bury the hatchet and agree to disagree, then?
No
Sure =)
I am listening to your arguement
huh?
Its interesting
hey micha, what's in haven?
I never expected either of us would change our stance in the course of that discussion xD
See, I might look like a nice middle-class boy on the surface...
=D
"nice"? ;)
Cheeky bastard XD
This has been one hell of an April Fools' Day, no?
Oh yes, truly briliant
Protests, helicopter crashes, and people finding severed heads.
Actually, that severed head thing could have been the best prank ever.
hey man
brb
iPal|PurpleAlex, if you immediately know the candlelight is fire, the meal was cooked a long time ago.
brb
We really did kill chat didn't we?
What is everyones favorite type of music?
Rap. Or Hip-hop.
rock/indie/pop mix I suppose you'd say
Bit of jazz too
I HATE JAZZ!!!!!!!!!
I like harder rock
jazz is great. So is swing
today at my school over twenty stink bombs got let off the whole school smelled like eggs it was disgusting
back
iPal|QUIT FIDGITING WOR- Oh my, PurpleAlex! You didn't hear that!
not metal though
....
Swing? Swing?!
=D
yes =p
I mock your taste in music.
Reminder of the good old days
*puts on Phil Collins*
That I didn't live through
God, I hate that man.
And have no memory of to be reminded of
Well, I can't argue, since I like classical music.
classical can be good too
But I listen to it as music, not as academic learning
Well, yes. Same.
So I know little about composers etc, just know what I like when I hear it
I couldn't recognise Beethoven from Mozart if I heard their music.
Who likes Endless War 3??
I mean, unless it was something really famous, obvs
Who like Resident Evil 5?
Yeah, of course
Gay game.
Are you serious?
RE5 is gay of all gay games.
Why?
I like a it of Wagner :D
IT'S LIKE THE SAME THING AS THE FORTH ONE!!!
Duh
0,1,2 and 3 are good.
Nah
I've not heard a lot.
BUT 5 AND 4 SUCK ASS!!
My favorites are 4 and 5
Big balls,I meant.
LOL
Other than Ride Of The Valkyries, but there are fetuses not yet born who've heard that.
Wat?
Very true

iPal|doglover99, if you immediately know the candlelight is fire, the meal was cooked a long time ago.

*wanders off to find a giant tub of ice cream*
Mint Chocolate > iPal
I think I'm going to be alright.
ok
The Queen for BI2...
Way to dissapoint
...
lv 44 with a colt = intense
95 more litres of blood!!
man getting all the trophies is annoying
so is lv45 with a colt
really should have started saving for minigun sooner, haha
XD
my bartender is badass, but not enough.....
yeah but the ammo costs 6 per bullet
yeah, but the colt is like throwing rocks
all my upgrades are maxed
just needt o buy the sniper, launcher,ak, shotgun, m4, and smg
what gun spills the most blood?
the weakest one
ok, haha
? isn't the blood based on the bunny?
so the colt without upgrades
Colt without upgrades..... you'd have to be even stupider than I am
yeah but you get more blood for the biggerbunnies
does anyone know how to get past the part where there are  just disappearing blocks and the collasping bridge?
hell i haven't upgraded crap for any of my weapons
my colt is maxed
that's all
and I'm on wave 45
what do you know i'm on wave 55
my mouse hates me
so does mine
freakin touchpad keeps acting retarded and not moving well
hahaha touchpad
ouch
yeah
i hade a mouse but it broke and so i have no mouse now
unless my parents take my brother's cpu cause he did something stupid
then i get to use the mouse since he has no use for it
holy crap the sniper rifle is badass
~whoa... whattaya doing online ACE?
hi
http://aoiscarlet.deviantart.com/art/Fragonard-Stolen-Kiss-114932943
~w00t... i finished it...
~2 hour homework =.=
congrats!
~dude! someone favorited my work the moment i uploaded it
~0.o;;
has anybody here played Kongai?
I did a couple times; not a huge fan of CCGs, though
sorry was getting raped by the bunnies
and kongrats aoi
~didja see it?
holy hell the sniper rifle kicks ass
nmope just got killed by the bunnies while using the uzi
at $8 a bullet, it should, but yeah
think that's awesome try the minigun while in rage mode
yeah, but sniper rifle's like permanent rage mode
i mean best rate of fire + 20 Strength + Rage = nohing left standing
35 strength per shot + ALWAYS goes through everything = nothing left standing, either
if i'm getting rushed and go to rage then i pull it out and then in seconds everything is dead
although i'm wasting all the ammo for the other weapons
but i love using grenades
60 shots for a level, $8 each, $18,912 money earned.... not bad
lol?
a knight's story just watch the knight level up?
59 bullets, 295.56 litres of blood
lol
have no idea if that's good or not, haven't been paying attention to blood
i only bought a shotgun smg ck9 pistol
I went from colt 45 to sniper rifle
doesn't look like I'm going to need a minigun
I'll be getting it just for the hell of it
25 min divide by 60 sec =?
divide by?
ya
if you want seconds, it's 1500, and multiply by
ok ok 25 min mutipli by 60sec =?
look up
well in wave 56 you are going to be zergling rushed so before it stock up on ammo
wow only 8 trophies left
~. . . i have so many doubles and triples in my Touhou folder...
~nearly 200 doubles/triples
i need one for lvl 60, killing a certain amount of bunnies, certain amount of liters of blood, 2 grenades, and 3 weapons
~and i'm maybe an 1/8 of the way...
~nearing 250 0.o;;
I haven't used any grenades other than the storyline ones, I should probably start that
250 duplicates?  o_O
~yeah...
~and this is not including pages from doujins
~and even some of my doujins are duped
~that means... i could probably free half of a gig of junk
I need to go through my devART folder, I probably have hundreds of dups myself
I had a ton of randomness on my old desktop, and then a ton of randomness on my laptop, and moved it all to my laptop
but have never sorted it, even though it's split between about 12 folders
it's getting frighteningly out of hand......
~mine's out of hand already 0.o;;
~stats...
~i have maybe over 9000 x 4 images
haha, x4
ouch
~and i've tried to sort out my images by character
~and that's like... 50 folders
~but i haven't tried sorting it out yet...
~and it currently takes...
I tried to sort by different reasons, but it was self defeating
~6.66 Gigs
I want some b/c of the shading, some for proportions, some for pose, but often they're the same photo, but needs to be in 12 different places
I'm at ~4.8 gigs, and that's just what I can find as devART for sure
~WTF!!!? it's 6.66 gigs, but it's taking 6.71 gigs of space on my PC
I have tons of non-devART and some random nonlabelled devART stuff, too
1) you have a virus, or 2) the numbers never match up exactly, anyway
~but i'm used to seeing the space on PC being lower than the size
~bleh... the problem with having a single folder with over 9000 x 3.9... it takes forever to load...
~oh my gosh! freaking 3 simutanious attacks on my village!
hahaha
~geez... i am completely out of sever 5...
travian?
~ya
~i can't play it anymore
ew
hehe
I could never really get into that game
~*but im on s6 and s7 at least*
too much babysitting for too little gameplay
lucky me man i sever 3x
~it's kinda fun when you're idling, but early on it's fustrating...
early on's not so bad
people ignore you
until one day, you get wiped off the face of the server
i attacking 1 noob who didnt log on for years
THEN it's frustrating
~my gost...
:P
~12 minutes till impact
~then 30 minutes till another impact
wow free resources like that
~even with my 5 crannies at max
~i can't hold off
~somebody gonna get raped
how to make so many crannys?
~i'm trying to train spearmen to piss off the farmers
~why five crannies? seems like overkill
~5000 resourcse
~tons of supporting villages?
~i need 3000 to make anything =.=
~waste of space, though, unless you're the mule town
go play sever 3x
everything is very fast
~i'm following an alliance around
main building only need 20+ min to build
~i found them on s6 and they want us to move on to s7 while everyone's fresh
`so what's so bad about being off s5, then?
~well... it was fun pissing off the farmer, he was  wasting 50 mens lives for nothing
i like s3x
~and i have about... 63 hours before my s5 account is deleted
~w00t for Last Stand feeling ^.^
im wiping ppl and talk peace and i only destroy the noobs
`sounds like YOU'RE the noob
ya
my travian name is noob
so i destroy the noobs
~heh, nice plan
lol
|you should call yourself |pro| and kill the pros|
god forbid you have a challenge
lol no i dun wan cos ppl will attack me to show that i am noob
~oh... wow... my first quadruple...
~and they were giant pics (1920x1000)
now i send 2 groups of noobs to attack the same village to destroy it
lol
that's not that giant
barely have to scroll to see it all
I've got some HQ photography that's about 6 times the screen
~ah... lemme see what's the largest image i have...
those suck up HD space like you wouldn't believe
~6600x2600
yeah, that's starting to sound better
~13.3 Megs...
although mine are more like 2600x6600
~largest sized image i currently have in the folder...
~i know i found one that was very tall...
haha, your sentences mess me up when you say numbers
because I read it as "about" and then wonder why you're giving decimals for an approximation
~lol 10,000x580
tutorial file?
~no, it's a scroll with half the touhou characters
individual pics?
i have very good reason to destroy other ppl's village
~no, it's one full picture
580 seems pretty narrow for a scroll
one full vert picture? sounds like there'd be a few transitions in it
~what's the term for a horizontal picture?
landscape
~ok, so that's what this is ^.^
and vertical is portrait
~ah, k
oh, right, x580
I read the numbers backwards
*facepalm*
~i think i might... have deleted the scroll with every touhou character...
*has never seen touhou*
~youtube it ^.^
~results from battle...
~30 casualties
~9 kills
that's it?
round 2 better be more exciting
~out of 750
~it was 30 vs 750, my army's dead and he took nothing from me
~next guy's facing maybe 3 soldiers
~20,000 x 600
~0.o;;
~oh it's the gothic lolita series...
ew
~i would let you see them... if i remembered where they were in my favorites ^.^;;
~this completely sucks... i think i did delete the only picture that had every touhou character from game 1 to game 12 and even the mangas
game?
~yup
"That's the thing about bunnies, they breed like rabbits."
such a lame ending
~"it's a game series about a bunch of lolis shooting each other out of the skies with walls of beautiful bullets"
ah
that'd be why I haven't heard of it
Did that picture happen to have Kanako at the top and Reimu and Marisa at the bottom?
I stay away from emo/gothloli/angsty kid stuff
~yes
~well, that definition is the simplified internet geek verison
~it's actually a very good shoot'em up series with alot of reflexes and memorization involved
~plus 2 fighting games to boot ^.^
Like... this?
http://www.k2.dion.ne.jp/~michiiyu/i_316.jpg
~found it!
~oro?
~yeah that one!
kenshin?
~^.^
I'd have to go with sano, personally  >_>
Wat the **** is this gMe" dont look back! '"
..........?
~i've also been known to say chii as well...
there is no g.loli in that scroll
you've also been known to ~
just a bit
~off to find the g-loli pic...
http://danbooru.donmai.us/data/f75a9546e67f929c09ac04889e9be4be.jpg
~i think that's the one...
~the 20,000 x 600 pic
~aaaand... i'm off to sleep...
night!
~i need to be up in 5 hours to head off to turn in my artwork...
~oh did you see it Beo?
I looked
looks like g-loli lite
~my DeviantArtwork ^.^
http://aoiscarlet.deviantart.com/art/Fragonard-Stolen-Kiss-114932943
oh, that
yeah
~suxxor doesn't it ^.^
the way you sounded proud, I was expecting a finished piece
haha
are you going to finish it?
everything sucks at the sketch level
~no, that's what it's supposed to look like, it's a gesture drawing
unless you're Chamba, Hoon, or the like
yeah, I know what a gesture drawing is
doesn't mean you won't finish it
~and also... i kinda screwed up the right-most side soo much...
then redo it!
:P
~i might try again in the future ^.^
I miss drawing
I should really try drawing something with my bamboo
off to sleep for me
I suck ass at drawing on a computer, but it's easier to keep and reuse than paper drawings, I'd imagine
~bywe all
I always lose all my paper stuff

Therefore, anti-cool is the opposite of uncool.

excellent point.
Yep.
I thought it was pretty  good.
Oh, dude.
Animal sucks in the morning.
=/
Animal?
Animal Planet.
Got a bit ahead of myself there.
what've they got?
Pet Star.
A dog just jumped eight hurdles.
ah.
kinda neat.
it's not even good enough to be ironically dorky.
No.
They have a lot of acts where they throw Frisbees, and the dog jumps up to get them.
My dog does that, and I don't beg people for money because of that.
the frisbee symbolizes the spirit world.
No.
It's a Frisbee.
it's a cigar!
No.
It's a hyper dog.
and an empty pie tin
it's an Ed Wood movie set.
That went over my head.
oh my
(Predictably.)
he was wonderful
he was a director of horrible b-movies who thought he was writing the great scripts that would save the world
Heh
his production values were really, really low, because even in the context of shooting with no budget & without a license, he didn't care about quality control -- night to day? no problem
he felt his scripts would be sufficiently riveting
Haha.
also he was a het mail cross-dresser
Like Eddie izzard.
was most proud of his sci-fi, but made "Glen or Glenda" about societal prejudice
well, yes, like Izzard 50 years earlier
also shot what passed for porn
Ha, ther's a movie about him.
oh, that's right, Tim Burton, it's good
"Plan 9 from Outer Space" is generally considered his trademark film
That's on the Queue!
I'll move it up
Done.
adventure!
One more episode, and then I can send these two movies back.
And see of my brother has finished Secondhand Lions.
episode of?
Zhipang.
is that good?
It's an anime about a modern Japanese warship that gets sent back in time to the Battle of Midway.
Surprisingly.
erm
I haven't watched any anime in years.
This was only at the behest of a friend.
well that's what you get for having friends!
I know!
it's all fun and games until somebody loses an eye!
D-
heh
Crap.
it's that crazy dog lady.
at the hotel?
No, on TV.
alas
It's Me or the Dog's Victoria Stillwell.
that's what I want on my tombstone
underneath the eight-foot tall angel with extended wingspan and flaming sword
Haha
"It's me or the dog"?
also the Victoria Stillwell bit
it's a cool name
Ahaha.
I'm still working on what I want on my gravestone.
I figure I've got 20 years.
the sun's burning out!
what happens in 20 years?
Me and Pa have A Plan.
oh yes?
It involves swords, a car, and the Autobahn.
indeed.
o.o
hey Spazz
Spazz!
Alos giraffes.
Hi Boredom, Queen. :]
A plan.
And
Some fireworks.
Fireworks! :D
Yes.
..Wait what are you talking about?
My planned death
And what I want on my gravestone.
..Where does the giraffe fit in?
never a sentence frightened me more than that.
Deathplan.
Uh huuh...o.o'
They're going to block off the Autobahn.
So nobody else gets hurt.
Clever.
They'll have banjos.
hi
For that surrealist touch
Hi
whats up
Woot. :]
all queens die, Stizer, but not all queens die in the presence of banjo-playing giraffes.
I hope to be the first.

Holy crap.
How's made is creepily addictive.
A game where I just sit back and do nothing. Time to relax
Needs music
Which?
Oh I'm playing a different one now
The other one, Knights Story, got boring quickly
Yeah.
I'll try frantic after this
Oh wow is that my battery? Charging an MP3 Player is a big drain on it!
Hold on till I plug in the charger...
The problem with Frantic is that it isn't...
Ok plugged in
Was Frantic the one with the cards?
No the Hundreds of Planes per second one
There are a few bullet-hel games.
You have to be more specific.
Am I the only one who finds Frantic boring? O.o
I haven't played it yet so I don't know
Mebbe I'm just used to curtain shooters...
It might raise my Blood Pressure a good bit though
back
amazingly, i had a schoolday where i actualy had to do some physical work
WOOO TAKE THAT
xd
Heh.
Ooo another boss
CHAARGE
boss?
Can't talk now. 3rd boss
He's playing Frantic.
oh
DEAD!
Onto the 4th level
Full adrenaline
better save it
Here it is
the boss
We don't need minute to minute updates.
I'm not giving min to min
Its more like 2 minute to two minute
Still, it's a bit floody.
Sorry. ARGH TOO MANY BULLETS
So, how's it going?
who?
About 200bps
Everyobdy.
Anybody.
Bunny Invasion feels too mcuh like a chore...
HOLY
hum
HAVE YOU SEEN THE AMOUNT OF BULLETS AT THE LVL5 BOSS!?
Yeah.
Chill out.
for a difference from the others,  imclueless and in love
It's so cute when they play their first Curtain Shooter...
I'm very deeply engaged, myself ;)
SHIIIII
Phew
Its over
*collapses back onto bed*
relax.  It's a zen-type thing
look for patterns
Really? I'm just going AHHHHH and moving wherever theres an opening
Let the Professor school you.
This is complete madness! Even though I'm relaxing
[Insert Obligatory "300" reference here]
Heh.
You know what is madness?  the crap on my TV.
I remember now why i don't watch much.
Oh...
shi...
whats on the tv?
Some model thing, I think.
They're doing a "laser maze challenge."
I'm doomed. This boss... is just...
They need a "mirror maze" challenge
I can't believe I just completed that boss
Haha
nothing like a good reality TV dose of people making total idiots of themselves, right? :p
The amount of bullets... so many bullets
Maybe they're all starve, Prof.
They'll all.
Stage seven... I'm doomed
I r can spell.
ARGHHHH
i own up these bunnies with my 12 gauge
In just 10 seconds I have a full adrenaline bar.
what upgrades are you using, by the way?
Laser Wingmen Lvl 3, lvl 3 bullet upgrade, adrenaline boost and that reload thing or whatever it is, lvl 2
not sure I'd recommend adrenaline boost, but...
Boss... shi...
Crap

>.>
We all mod differently.
There is nothing wrong with the way Queen does things :)
im guessing modship reflects the mod, and queens too nice
Queen? Nice? Never :P
We're supposed to warn them.
Warn who of what?
Trolls.
Offenses.
Of course. Everyone deserves a chance to reform their character
brb changing games

Holy drunkface?
Also, we all need to send Duckie birthday wishes.
We do?
It IS his birthday.
It is?
It is.
Well, if he was ever on anymore, I might know these things
I know.

What does he do all day that means he can't come to talk to us?
yyyyes

Ahaha.
I think this is where you are supposed to apologise for that insult :P
No.
What? What do you mean, no?
I think she meant no....
I know that, I was just querying how she coudl possibly say no to me
Easy, look I can do it. No.
But I haven't asked you to do anythign yet. And I don't flirt with you
Good point, ask me to do something.
But there is nothing I need doing. At least, nothing you can help me with
Ok
I would of just said no anyway.
I figured that much. I see Queen is conveniently avoiding me now
Sorry, minor crisis/
Gotta go.
Fair enough. Hope you sort it out. bye x
hi
how many lvls are there before the boss in colourpod 2?

AutoimmunityDude! You just completed the Autoimmunity achievement in Cell Warfare and won the Autoimmunity badge and 15 points!
Kongratulations, thehatter!
how do you put that almost before i say that ive won a badge?
HOW?
ctrl + v
I could put a delay on it....
no, how does ipal say "kongratulations" just after i say ive won a badge?
He watches what you say
yea but that's quick typing...
I told you, ctrl + v
actually, he's just interpolating a string in his memory with your name and outputting it to his socket connection
BUT HE PUTS "THEHATTER"! HE DOESN'T SAY THAT TO ANYONE ELSE BUT HE'S STILL QUICK!
that's what I said :P
Or, to put it simply, ctrl + v
*hyperventilating*
honestly, it's closer to "Ctrl + V, type out the name, hit enter"
and someone with m4d tjpnk sk33lz could do it that fast.
or a computer
More likely m4d tjpnk sk3lz
or a computer
Thats bonkers.
yes!
Wow.  I got the last time trophy as I was looking to see it was the only thing left to earn...

Congratulations!

pissed off with the context menu being accidentally activated whilst playing games, and causing me to lose
Couldn't you just develop better control of your extremities?
I'm actually on here from underwater.
>_>
i try, but it is hard to concentrate on a game and keep my fingers off the right-button
Concentrate harder.
Train yourself.
Take steroids.
One of those is a bad idea.
thanks for the advice :)
the pen lid is in place, so i shall have another go at the cell warfare impossible
No worries. It's what I'm here for, after all.
*puts on some Verdi and goes back to Amorphous*
If I had a pipe, I'd be smoking it now.
with what content? London special?
Something like that. I don't have a lot of knowledge of pipe tobacco.
I mean, I've only ever smoked once.

well how can you tell if this smiley =) is bald or not?
You can't. Unless you used (=) for hair.
a mullet?
Although, B=) is Elvis, so.
haha
I guess that'd make [=) a crew-cut.

*ties a bandana and hides under a cardbox*

Never played a Mario game, either.
It's on my to-do list.
With about eighteen hundred other things.
o.o

iPal|Ah, guitarman4life, my loyal servant. Hello.
you should simply get a wii and SSBB PA
Eh.
I've played the Brawl game they made before that
Didn't do a lot for me
you dont need to play brawl before SSBB, there is not realy much difference
Even worse, then
If it's the same as the one before, which I didn't like, then I won't like the latest one.
probably not
Also, I can't afford a Wii. I blew all my money on rent-boys and cocaine.
though, its better than tekken
Never played that, either.
o0
what console games have you played?
cocaine??
...
Pong?
;)
No, it's just that I keep missing out on these classic franchises.
I hadn't even seen the original Star Wars movies until yesterday.
Did you watch them all yesterday
?
No, just the first one
ok lool
The next two are in the post from Lovefilm.
I love lovefilm
I am ambivalent towards it. Saves me from going out to Blockbuster, though.
i saw all of the star wars movies a=nd im only 12
That's good.
:)
Can you rent games with love film?
I think so, but I've never done it.
I either buy them, or pirate them in exceptional circumstances.
Mmmk.. Just coz my brother has netflix, and he loves that..
Yeah, I looked into that, but I don't think they have Netflix in the UK.
Lovefilm's the next best thing.
lol
I'm in the UK, though.. My brother is not

Oh, Beogard, to answer you're original question, go to the programming forum and look for the one I started, should be at the top, if not the top few.

I always assumed that, too.
And you had the chat read to you by Text-To-Speech.
come read it to me?
Mmkay.
I think you'll agree that I have a lovely voice.
I wouldn't know, I'm deaf.
Deaf and illiterate? Oh my.
Im not sure if that is a joke or not :/
hey cj

You're screwed if they work out a way of writing sign language.

No....
Its in AS2, remember
And underscores dont show
AS2 or AS3?
gotoAndStop(2)
In the forums
you go on to _root.ball.y -= 70, so I'm thinking AS3?
Its as2
Ack
Splitting headache
either way, you posted "root" and "_root"
Mouth tastes like ashtray
Back teeth ache
Underscores dont show in the forums
Halp
I use AS3, but I'm assuming they should match in AS2 as well
oh, the formatter eats underscores

ron? ron r u there?
hey phillies
you only hide the mouse when the player's moving down?
or are you wanting to hide it all the time?  because it looks like you've got it trapped in the "move down" loop
What are you on about? The mouse is only HIDDEN all the time, it still follows the mouse ALL the time.
wut server r u on phllies
this 1
which 1
fitz
I don't get the posting tags..... I'm going to repost your code
Someone has replied on that topic, and I dont know what they mean =(
im on its new yorkw8ing 4 u
it looks like your Mouse.hide() is inside the if loop for moving downwards
ok phillies go to the search tab and search yummypython and lets play my leve;s
Nah, it isnt
sorry, I mean the else loop
Actually....
the way it's posted, it is
Ever way, it still hides it the way I want it to
right, but if you want it to be always hidden, you should have it listed at the start, outside of loops
it might work fine THIS time, but you could have problems in the future
Do you understand what Draco posted. At the end.

I dun really care, if it's not a major cut.
kitty, did your dress fit this time?
Eh?
this is my specialty
nip is a racist term against japanese people kitty
Oh, it's too big, I'ma take it in when I feel lik sewing.

2009-03-05 16:09:13 ElMicha: k

bah, my internet died briefly
well
if its true, can it be called racism?
Three proofs the english language is faulty; cough, through, and dough
?
Say 'em outlough
*outloud
only three?
Same ending, different phonetics.
can't hit all nine of them?
Not only 3, just giving 3.
uhm
Mercy KillingDude! You just completed the Mercy Killing achievement in Bunny Invasion 2 and won the Mercy Killing badge and 30 points!
Kongratulations, VaanStrifer!
try "dove" and "read"
?
i no that thing was HUGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
norsk gramatikk er en del enklere, hvis alle hadde l?rt seg det ^^
Oh I see
that's what she said
Say "dove" out loud.
DOVE
Then tell me if you're talking about a verb or a noun.
With read, is it present tense, or past tense?
someone of you americans try saying that norweigan sentance out loud =P
It's hard to tell, though they ARE pronounced differently
I dunno how to say hvis, but otherwise it's fine.
read (present tense) vs. reed
said it micha
or bat (baseball) vs. bat (flying rat)
hvis?
Not a rat, just a relative.
You said it first, micha
i dont see whats hard about it
Looks a lot like German, Micha.
I'm just not sure I'm saying it right. xD
there is a lot similiar to german beo =P
So how's the "v" pronounced?  Like we pronounce w's?
oops
kitty, say kjetil og kjartan
f's, I meant
no, not like the w
Lol that one's fun. What's it mean? xD
uum, actually norwegian is one of the harder languages for a foreigner to learn round and about, elmicha...
its like a w with your forteeth on the underlips, kinda
kyeteel?  you can't even write phonetically with Engrish......
i know, it got some tricky ways to say stuffs =P
engrish?
the most horribly broken language in existence
kjetil og kjartan? thats just 2 normal norweigan names XD
haha
thats why we speak it beogard
hasn't had a spelling update in something like 1,600 years
5 letters to represent 16 consonantal sounds
I like german~
and I think the consonant count is around 26, if I remember right.
you should learn a scandinavian language kitty =3
that's cuz the people who speak english tend to be arrogant
and what do we do when we teach people to read?
"Sound it out."
**** we're dumb.
I'd rather finish learning german first, Micha. Unless german counts?
germans cant understand when norwegians talks
Didn't think so
Germans can't understand when Germans talk.
but, we might understand partialy their conversations
lol
why go all the way to Norway?
:P
I understand hearing germans talk, Beo, and I'm AMERICAN.
well, sweden and denmark works as well
I'm sure if I can they can.
nobody's american...
my family speaks Low German
Low German?
finnish is completely different...
if I speak High German to them, they have no idea what I'm saying
What's the dif?
High German is the standard language
if you've studied German, you've learned High German
You mean the more formal stuff?
and low german is...?
Low German is a dialect, which is extremely common in Canada.
Oh I see
okay...
Well I didn't say I understood CANADIAN germans.
so there's REAL german, and then there's CANADIAN german
I can understand my German relatives when they talk, but my parents don't speak German, so I've never learned Low German
Where do you think Canadian Germans came from?
lol, flying meat. xD
Do you understand GERMAN ones?
they came from canada
but their ancestors came from germany
Somewhat... I'm still learning.
but they evolved the language
or devolved
in some cases, but Canada is less than 200 years old
So, not FULLY fluent, but I can get the general gist usually
not all immigrants have lived here for generations
yeah, well, i don't care about germans even if i'm 1/4 german
there are 3 languages i want to learn
yeah, I can tell
gaelic, russian, and french
must be nice, having never left your country, still feeling safe and arrogant in your tiny bubble
why gaelic?
cuz it sounds cool
My dad's family is all decended from Germany, even though we've been in Texas for generations
My mum's side is mostly norwegian and hungarian
o0
and i WANT to leave my country
hm
Pest ControlDude! You just completed the Pest Control achievement in Bunny Invasion 2 and won the Pest Control badge and 5 points!
Kongratulations, aleric15!
but i just can't yet
there are more norwegian ancestors in norway than there are people in norway...
ancestors in america*
haha
I was confused
cuz teh norwegians came to american and went ape on each other
how many people are there in Norway?
lol wait what?
yup
im not sure
google it
but i remember its half of londons population
google=universal tool
*has no idea what London's population is, either*
geography = not my strong suit
note, LONDONS population, not even entire england...
Ask PA?
neither are the stats that go with it
uhm
4.6 million
Norway's a lot larger than England, though
i realy doubt PA knows facts abut london
yup
not overly populated?
beo, size of the land has nothing to do with size of the population
were just, not making as many babies as other countries =P
London's population is somewhere aroudn 10 million
you think, dave?
Hahaha, is funny 'cuz norway is phallic. XD
second largest city is 250k in pop.
k, so we are 5-6 milinons in norway
Half of Canada can't be lived in.
lol, norway is f*ckin cold
mivha
it is?
that's why people left
dave
we do get 30c in the summer
...micha, you lie, four and halv mill...
Maybe that was sweden...
that's all good, but how long is the summer?
fine, i just being told stuffs here fluff
the question that stands
uhm
3 months?
bull
You guys probably get weather like us, I'd imagine.
i call bull
and 3 months winter
i still call bull
8shrug* Makes sense to me
3-4 months summer, and wicked wind in the winter?
usa has realy varied weather...
I don't think Norway is that cold, except maybe right at the top
though, we got no storms at all
sorry, by "us" I mean Canada.
ah
I live a bit to the north. :P
y norway is kinda a european miniature of canada
Texas rarely gets below 30
a norwegian has crossed canada at its length by foot though
And often gets above 100 in summer
So warm~
0.0
100 fahrenheit
I forget my conversions....... don't remember where zero is on your scale, Kate
Yeah xD
norway goes around -20c to 30c through a year
32 farenheit is 0 celsius
who was that, micha?
and as a note, water freezes at 0c
32? thanks
thought it was around that
and ~70 = ~20 ?
*shrug*
cara said there were 10 million londoners fluff
72F is room temperature? should be around 21C then, I think
Think you could deal with over 50 degress celsius, guys? :P
there are online calcs for that stuff people
We get above 30 here every now and then.
Yeah, Beo.
uhm
id definetly sweat kitty...
We get 40 below with windchill all the time.
no, sorry, I was thinking about what daft norwegian crossed canada, who was that?
Well, obviously, Micha. xD
oh
We hit -50C here once or twice a year.
Lars Monsen
D:!
i think of it this way, normal human body temp is 96-97 degrees fahrenheit and it's like 29 celsius
uhu
Don't think I could take 50C, though.
and then freezing is 0C and 32F
I always hide under blankets in winter. xP
Did that in China, it damn near killed me.
oh yeah, that lunatic. shouldve guessed...
ive heard that at -50c, your spit freezes to ice before it hits the ground
Well, we get temperatures close to 50c in Aus in the summer, so...
96 is 29 celsius?
don't know about your spit, but what you do is fill a cup with hot water, and throw it in the air
it makes this wicked crackling sound, and evaporates
o0
has to be hot, though, or else it just freezes
no, 96 is 35 celsius
hm, is 100f=30c?
oh
like, boiling hot
-40 = -40
other than that, there's something to do with 9/5 - 32 or something
Ohhh my bad.
I always forget the conversion
100 would be 37 El
then, summers might get as hot in norway as they get in texas kitty =3
Apparently, 100 ferenheit is only 38 celsius...
oh, okay
yeah, that sounds right
okay, so i was 10 off
40C weather sucks hard
too hot
I used to go shopping, just so I could be around the massive air conditioners in the stores
Its been getting up to 47 in Australia recently
and I hate shopping
though its nice time to go swimming
I was thinking since water boils at around, like, 220F, I think, 100Fwould be 50C, since 100C is boiling, right?
but 0 isn't 0
-40 is -40
100c is boiling yes
0C is 32F, remember?
and 0c is freezing
Riiight
50c would be 122
I could deal with that, assuming there was a pool. xD
126F?
52c
hm
huh
then is 0C not 32F?
It is, Beo.
or 100c not 220F, I guess
im sure they get summers with 50c in denmark, and they got a lot of nice tourist houses
b/c I was trusting Kate with my math
Dude! You just completed the Easter Spirit achievement in Bunny Invasion 2 and won the Easter Spirit badge and 30 points!
Kongratulations, groceryfiend!
no, nought is 32. and 100 is 212
and the entire country is great for biking
Pffft I hate math
hm
*does college grade math*
math isn't bad, as long as you remember the formulae
*used to do engineering math*
*looks down on "college grade"* :P
I hate maths
Considering I'm 15, Beo, it's kinda major.
*is fair at math*
yeah, that is pretty good
*hates maths, though*
I can do maths, I just hate it
also, for making a tourist visit to norway
http://www.savalen.no/index.php?lang=en
=3
why are you doing college grade, then?
Who's visiting Norway?
Because I finished high school stuffs
duno, but the webpage might get u interested in it
Hate does not mean bad at.
what grade are you in?
I dunno
Don't quite think its an appropriate destination for my honeymoon
I never said you were bad at it, Kate.
depends on time of the year cara
just curious why you would do college grade if you're not at college
if you don't like it
Because it'll look good on a transcript. >.<
I was thinking more sun, sea and beach though
I wanna be a psychologist, though...
well then denmark works
o that reminds me
Hmm, but that's not that much of a trip from France. And I wanna go somewhere completely new
Antarctica?
lots of sun and sea!
2009-03-05 16:42:23 Beogard: not so much beach...
lol. I was thinking more the Carribean
somewhere new, with sun and beaches
yeah, s'pose it's a bit cold for the beach
beaches
beo, there's only lots of sun during the summer, winter there's 22 hours of night and the other 2 aren't exactly light...
Exactly El
hm
Yeah, and if you go to the arctic, there's GIANT MOSQUITPES
*MOSQUITOES
Only in summer, though.
In which case, I am so not going there
huh, i didn't know that
mauritus, cara
sarcasm.  Google it.
Hmm, Mauritius sounds appealing
can't google, going to go shoot some terrorists
obviously I don't know where Cara's been, so how could I know where somewhere new is?
g'night everyone
google it
night
Mexico? Spain?
Brasil?
z not s.
I live in France. Spain is not so new. But I've never been to Mexico or Brazil
I think Brasil's my next destination.
any more to filter by cara?
depends who you ask, kate
My map says z.
Maybe I should employ you as my wedding planner El, and my honeymoon can eb your first task
where kitty?
It probably does, yes.
What?
hm
z where?
Mine won't.
Brazil
and cara, id like to
payment? =3
Really? You would?
xd
Minimum wage?
nah, if id seriously plan a wedding for a friend, i do it free
The more I pay you, the tighter the budget for the honeymoon would have to be. You work out the split
You do not want to plan weddings El, way to much hassle. Trust me
id plan my own when the times comes...
No, leave it to someone else. Think of your sanity
I probably will, but I'll need someone to keep me on track. I dunno if I'll ever get married, though. *shrug*
I used to say I never would
my head is so stupid it isnt capable of becoming insane ^^
I'm not saying never, I'm saying I dunno.
2009-03-05 16:48:44 CaraAdele: Everyone is capable of becoming insane El.
i doubt it
there ya go, kate. http://www.formulaworldshop.com/images/soccer/a8pelejersey.jpg
Eh?
What's this for, Beo?
a nation would know how to spell its own name, yes?
Hey guys
Long time no se
yo
Where does it say brazil?
see*
*is incredibly hard of sight*
ah
hm
under the emblem
they keep it tiny, yeah
Ah I see. You're right, sorry.
kitty, why doubt that you would get married?
*shrug* I dunno, I'm not doubtin, it just might not happen.
I used to say that too
make it happen ^^
I don't really care if i get married at this point. I'm not against, but I don't want to for another decade or so atleast.
=S
How old are you?
And I definitely do NOT want kids yet. xD
15. So it's a reasonable thing.
me neither, i wouldnt dream of getting married for at least 6 years ahead, but im pretty sure id get married sometime
Now, I'm with you on that one
15? Well, wait five years then ;)
More like a decade, kthx.
Why? I'm 20
*wants to have a job etc first*
Jobs are so overrated lol
lol
depends on the job
Yes, but I wanna be a psychologist.
if the job gets you a privatre jet...
I wanna be a lawyer. What difference does the type make?
Study of the mind is incredibly intruiging to me, so lemme hae a chance to get bored of it BEFORE I quit. xD
Why does getting married = quitting job?
All the people, so many people, and they all go hand in hand, hand in hand through their, Parklife... (Know what I mean?)
find a husband to help you with it kitty? =P
Because I'm not planning on getting married that soon unless I get knocked up.
PA!!!!! Where should I go on my honeymoon?
And if I get pregnant, I'll wanna stay home to take care f the kid.
im training to be a doctor
SO, I will end up quitting.
Solution = no kids :)
Hrm. Saint Lucia.
Ooooh. Where's that exactly?
Caribbean.
Yeah, I know, hence me saying I'm not getting married that early unless I'm knocked up. :P
So marriage DOES mean quitting for me. For now.
Sounds liek a good place. I might check it out. Thanks
It's very tax-haven-y, which means lots of cash floating about.
Well, I have no intention of getting knocked up, or quitting my non-existent job
Lots of cash? Cash for me?
lol, me neither. xP
Depends. If you can defraud some money-launderers, probably.
After a major emotional trauma thing, you decide you wanna wait longer for marriage.
Fraud and money launderers, soundsliek my kind of thing ;)
... Also my brothers. MAJOR discouragment for having kids.
I don't know about that. I thought that, but them when the right guy came along.
They're adorable little packages of PURE ****ING EVIL
Then just have girls?
*shrugs*
*snickers*
You shoulda met ME as a kid.
lol. Were you worse?
I was a frikkin' monkey, I could open child safety doors and pick locks ar age 1. :3
o0
*intensely dislikes monkeys, but it fits*
wow bunnies pooping bunnies ha i love this game
Right, so have girls, and live in a bubble?
sounds like dangerous genes there...
...I think I have someone muted.
I just really don't want kids...
How did we get onto living in a bubble?
If I have kids like my sis was, that'd be great.
She was sweet and fell asleep very easy, sometimes in her food.
muted kitty pa?
Mmmyep
Well, if they are in the bubble, there will be nothing requiring safety doors or locks to pick, so the kids will be safe
Oh, yes.
=o
You can't raise kids in a bubble, Cara
What if it pops?
Cara, I'd rather just not have kids.
2009-03-05 16:59:35 PurpleAlex: Also, I nearly typed 'pops' with an extra o
PA, you have emergency saftey procedures for that sort of thing. Duh!
Which raises an equally valid complaint
And the equally same valid answer
Procedures.
Heheheheh
What kind of procedures?
Kitty, is that not a good thing?
do something about them first thn kitty
*is cracking up*
No, Cara. xD
They're too big already. Frikkin udders.
PA, if I told you I would have to kill you
...
I'm sure they're not that bad
DD. ._.
Is that all I get PA? Three little dots?
2009-03-05 17:01:49 CaraAdele: I threaten to kill you and that's all you can say?
Kitty, mine are F. And I do not think they are huge, I quite like them
0o WOW
I've been getting used to threats lately.
I secretly like mine, but I don't want 'em bigger. xP
wait what are we talking about?
And ellipses are a perfectly natural way to respond to them.
Really? Who else has been threatening you? They should know by now that only I am allowed to do that
wow, this is an awesome room
yo wat up guys
*hides*
You'd be surprised Kitty. Especially as men seem to like it
Eh. I slagged off my old school on m'blog and it's come back to bite me in the arse.
El, why are you hiding? Did you threaten PA?
define threat
~chii ^.^
=P
Did you ahve good reaosn for doing it?
yo scarlet
probably
Of course I did. I was pissed off, and worst of all I was right.
El, a threat is anything which proposes to injure him, or kill him etc. Requires physical violence
In arguments amongst Britons, that's the only unforgivable sin.
no then
*stops hiding*
Well, if its any consolation, I forgive you
^_^ Aw. Cheers.
At least you know what you are nto allowed to do, for future reference, El
Congratulations! You've just completed the 500 Litres of Blood on the Wall Challenge! You have earned a card from our collectible card game.
yup
..as long youre here
http://teenagemisanthropy.blogspot.com/2009/02/red-brick-monstrosity-2-electric.html
That's alright. Like I said, I can be mean to you, btu if anyone else is, you let me know
Dude! you just completed
Dude! You just completed
Kongratulations, jamesty!
Unless I stole your fianc?, in which case you'd beat me to death
Hell hath no fury, and all that.
No. I would torture you, tear strips of you, and then I'd beat you to death.Please get it right
im back!
wb
I prefer to keep my being tortured to within my spare time, thanks.
torture and death?
cara, if you do put it on youtube k?
It's an occupational health and safety minefield, anyway.
i love bunny invasion 12 gauge rules
i'm on minigun
i havent tried 12 gage
im on wave 34
i have th M4
idk what wave i'm on
Bwarg disconnected for a sec sorry
lol
=o
fifty something
hi kitty
nothing important happening
El, I certainly wouldn't. Then people woudl find out. But I woudl send you a secret video
=O
great =)
What wouldn't Micha do?
I'm a little suspicious of your motives there, El.
dont be PA
Oh, but I am.
kitty, a goal of my life is to try everything
PA, it would be a video of you, being tortured. What si there to be suspicious of?
that is, withing limits
I'd say that's pretty suspicious in and of itself
Oh I wanna see
limits of my physical health
Given that it's either a crime, or someone's been recording my saturday nights
its formicha only though =(
2009-03-05 17:10:21 ElMicha: id pass it to you kitty
Neither is an appealing thought.
!lastseen queentakesrook
curugulkano, I saw queentakesrook 6 hours ago
huh
knwoing a lot of online people wana see you in pain?
PA, I don't commit crimes. As a member of the secret service, I am entitled to kill you, for national security reasons ;)
Which secret service?
If you're DGSE, you'll find I'm harder to scupper than a boat full of hippies.
>_>
Again, if I told you that, I'd have to kill you
MI6
*wonders how many people will get that reference*
tell him then cara!
^^
Man, how did I get to be the bad guy in this scenario?
El, Now I'm worried about you. Maybe Kitty needs to qualify quick?
PA, you threatened to steal Pierre. Again.
Qualify for what?
dont worry, be happy
I jested of it.
As a psychologist, you said. El needs help
she thinks you need to check my mentality kitty
And you used what has come to be called a disproportionate response.
Ohhhh
hola peoples =P
*is not paying attention at all
ah well, go ahead
*tips hat*
Disproportionate? You have failed to gauge my feelings for him into that calculation, obviously
yo
Plenty of people are in love, but most of them don't go in for torturing people.
Outside of divorce settlements.
I prefer being tortured, actually~
Physical only, kthx.
o0
But...But... What is wrong with torture?
Nothing, in a risk-aware, consensual context.
But I don't consent to you tearing strips off me.
>_>
3000 more to minigun
So, if I make you say yes first, then it woudl be ok?
I think coercion kind of negates the point of consent.
You'd have to seduce me. And that's more or less impossible, barring you becoming male.
*is blown out*
What're you blown out by? xD
I think coercion kind of negates the point of consent.
make sure you have plenty of ammo for wave 56
that
It does, Micha. xD
What? What's wrong with that sentence?
the words
PURPLEALEX!
They're used correctly!
*tips hat*
Coersion, forcing. Consent, agreement.
Hello Dion.
they are words that doesnt tell me anything
Your ignorance is noy my fault.
*not
k thanks kitty
PA, I'm sure I coudl get you to consent if I wanted to
*isnt blown out anymore*
Oh? How would you go about doing that?
LIVER AND KIDNEY PIES
Well, if I tell you, it wouldn't work, would it?
Tell him that, Cara!!

Kittykatk8, who is gonna coerce Alex with liver and steak pies?
~seriously...
How about if I got you some gay strippers, and part of their act was to 'torture' you?
?
You deceitful woman! It's genius.
~ok, im tired... gonna go into lurking mode
Or was it liver n kidneys...
I know. I am a genius. Why do you think I have Dan bowing to my superiority?
or take a short nap scarlet?

Lol. Most women have an IQ above that, PA
~yay i got good remarks about my drawing ^.^
That one's hard to say xD
That was rather what I was getting at.
?
Rightly so, Aoi, tis good.
well, its not bad scarlet
And I read your blog thing. Sounds to me like the lot of them are neanderthals who need to drag themselves into the 21st century, remove their prejudices and stop describing you as everything they are.
~it was such a (insert bad language here) to make though!
^_^ Thanks very much for saying so
kitty, svalahaue pie is something even better ^^
Not to mention the million contradictions that appear in their letter
I simply speak my mind, PA, and that was the feeling that I got
It's nice to know I'm not being irrational, then.
Obviously, in slightly more polite words than I actually thought when I read it
Also nice to know that you'd tell me if I was completely bonkers and in the wrong, too.
Frankness FTW
What is it, though?
svalahaue= a kind of food made of sheep heads
In recompense, you have my word I'll keep my coveting personage away from your betrothed >_>
2009-03-05 17:22:55 PurpleAlex: *is using big words unnecessarily*
Of course I would. That is what I am here for. And thankyou, that is good to know. Compromise is always the best solution
*luckily, I understand the big words. I can be posh too you know*
Quite so. Conflict resolution.
Of the kind they have yet to try in Palestine, I'd imagine.
Although, I am partial to a good argument every now and then. With words, not bullets, obviouslyu
I have given up with Palestine. Both sides are as bad as each other
(In the interests of balance, I spell it Palestine, but pronounce it 'Israel')
lol.
Very true. I read an article by Johann Hari that characterised the offensive as 'Israel self-harming'
Stupid Video strip poker gme is to hard
>_>
kitty, that food being norwegian, you might figure why i want foreign food
Hey Joe
Hey Alex
yo joe
Indeed I do, Micha.
Yo Micha
Off topic, how come you are not going to uni, PA?
video poker?
Considering America is famous for burgers and fried chicken, you can understand why -I- want foreign food. xD
Video STRIP poker
>.>
Well, I had a nervous breakdown midway through my A-levels.
And I cant get more than the guys vest off
Frogs legs and snails, Kitty?
Urrgh, not.
hm
I like mexican food~
Who wears a vest these days, anyway?
The vegetarian stuff.
Oh. You could take them again, though?
WHo kows
Well, that's the idea.
I wear a bandana occasionally
Also oriental. :3
o.o
she means natchos
Which ones did you take?
The problem's just one of getting back into a college or something.
Especially when im cleaning
Oriental? As in dog and horse meat?
though
I was taking English, French, German and History.
No I mean most of the vegetarian stuff
No the vegetarian stuff.
i could live long on hamburgers and chicken
Lo mein, tofu, etc.
Didn't even take any of the exams, though.
I'm vegetarian, won't eat 'em if you pay me.
I love lo mein
Lots of languages there. And you seem cleevr. There must eb some place that will take you
Unless it's, like, ALOT of money. xD
http://www.johannhari.com/archive/article.php?id=1423)
Thanks very much.
The problem isn't not being accepted
=O
What is it then?
It's me feeling able to be back in full-time education
you mean money may make you abandon your cause kitty?
Psychologically, that is.
I choose not to eat meat because it makes me sick, and it's bad for your health.
You could do it. You just need a place with less prejudices and old school attitudes
oh
Maybe try a state school
Well, that's true. But it's foolish to deny there's a problem on my end.
I don't approve of slaughter houses etc either, but I'm not going to make a difference by eating a piece of chicken.
Most of the ones I'm looking at are community colleges, yeah
o.o
eating chicken is a lot better for the health too
I go to a really nice community college
I'm not trying to get you to deny there si a problem.I am merely suggesting that it may have been contributed to significantly by external factors
but, any fish kitty?
Oh, I don't doubt that.
I don't like fish.
Except canned tuna, love that, but won't eat it.
what about sushi?
ewww
Well then. And if all else fails, you coudl come to Australia and visit me. When Pierre is away, obviously
australia?
i thought it was france
Heh. If I could afford a plane ticket to Aus, then I'd love to.
she moved
I'm moving.
Sell your body on the corner for a couple of hours
'D
quite thr traveler
ahh
oh
Its not that expensive.
lol
Joe, I doubt I'd get much demand =D
Not really travelling. Its where I grew up, I'm just going home
If you got a haircut I might be interested
X3
Depends which corner you pick, PA
I've *had* a haircut
*bats eyelashes*
;)
Really?
=o
Ya rly.
I wanna see!
Somewhere in Amsterdam, or the middle of Soho, you might get lucky
I did a vlog where I and my very very short hair appear.

Link?
o.o

http://teenagemisanthropy.blogspot.com/2009/02/whine.html
I just got a haircut yesterday but its horrible and way to short
Yh, El, isn't that in Soho?
no, amsterdam
brb
iPal|We know why you're leaving us, Kittykatk8, and we are sad.
its a wrldwide known street
though
there might be one in soho too
Omg
Oh my God PA, what happened to your hair?
Thats shorter than mine!
'Red light district' is a generally accepted term.
>>;
Well, I got a shit haircut, so I shaved it out of spite.
Now its too short
I need enough to get my fingers through
Well try this again in about 3 weeks o_o
It's actually growing fairly quickly.
*cracks up again*
I liked it better before. And I don't usually like long hair on guys. But it seemed to suit you
Im getting new glasses
Tell you what, I'll grow it back out and we'll meet in the middle.
Kinda like yours but maybe thicker
Alex... BALD! *cracks up more*
I miss it, Cara
and nerdier
Kitty, you should watch that, or there will be too many pieces of you for me to stick back together

Watch what, Cara?
Cracking up all the time
Sounds awesome, Joe
Ohhhh

Where would you like to start, Spazz
OK
Back to this dumb strip poker game
>_>
hold on, I'll get you an answer Kitty. PA, why do you hate Kitty?
I will get this dude naked
Uhm, long ago at the castle by the seaaa.
o.o; Joooe?
For ****'s sake, Joe, just find some porn and be done with it
which castle? which sea?
Thats to easy
She annoys me on a primal level.
X3
She does? Why?
Turn your monitor upside-down, then go find porn.
...My castle by the see, where a girl lives by the name of Annabelle Lee. :]
Because I'm female?
lol
I have a laptop
Kitty that makes no sense. .-.
I don't know. She just rubs me the wrong way (ha ha ha, raucous laughter)
at least she doesnt any me ^^
I'm female, I don't
Lol
*glomps kitty*
Lol Alex..
It made perfect sense, Anna. *isglomped*
Heheh, hi. :3
o.o
...Why?
Maybe I'm just a closet mysogynist, I don't know. *shrugs*
PA, maybe you could give her another chance?
'cuz Alex is gay, I'm female.
...only because you asked me to.
*pats kitty*
..But...I'm female. And to my knowledge thus far, he doesn't hate me. .-.
o.o
..Wait.
EArs plz? :3
hm
He's gay, so he hates females?
Aww, I love havign you wrapped round my little finger, PA ;)
^_^
Im gay and I dont hate females
*carefully scrathes behind kittys ears*
He doesn't hate me, as far as I can tell
That is such a generalization.

I have a weakness for manipulative women. It's gotten me in trouble before. =D
Haha.
Except for the fact that I have something that he wants, of course
LOL
*would like learning to purr*
wassup
I don't remember getting you into trouble, PA, and I seem to be good at manipulating you
0o purring is easy
A different manipulative woman, I'm afraid.
You don't hold a monopoly.
:o
The only manipulative woman in my life is my mother
>>;
Ahaha.
X3
What? I don't? What do I have to do to get you all to myself? First the threats, now this
Oh, don't worry, this was long in the past.
I have a friend who makes you feel really bad if you ever say no to anything she asks you to do.
..Which I realize didn't come out the right way.
>.>
I have a friend like that
But I laugh at her
and shes ur friend?
...you assumed we'd be thinking of sexual favours, Anna
It can't have been that long ago, you're not that old
In fairness, my mind is that dirty, so I was.
That's what I was thinking. e/e
e.e*
PA, do you ever think of anythign else?
friends are worthless
A year and a half at least.
Nope. It's a full-time job.
"Oooh, Anna, I spent FOUR HOURS AND THEN SOME casting this play, wanna hear your parts?!" *Dies* x.x
We may be gay but were still men so what.. we think about sex every 3 seconds?
Well, I coudl maybe live with that. Do I have a monopoly now then?
also
Yes.
GOOD friends arent worthless
Heheh. xD
Hurrah! Good to know I have someone I can get to do what I want, when I want ;)
Which is just as well, if there was anyone else I think you'd do dreadful things to them.
Kinky...o.o'
I think anout sex more now that im single and not having it than I did when I was with my ex and getting some occasionally. >'
Phoone.
What sort of person do you take me for? Obviously, I woudl hire someone to do that. It doesn't do to get your hadns dirty with that sort of thing
brb

X3
*BA hacks again!*
It is very sexy, Spazz. Almost as sexy as PA
AOI
;D
^_^ I am very sexy, though
the brides dress is white to symbolise happiness right?
Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue, remember. :D
I think I may be weighting the scale.
No white is for virginity
No, purity, Micha.
Hides stains well.
then, why does the men wear black?
PA, inappropriate!
oh no not aoi, blazen, i just hacked
I was talking about water. You know, in case it rained.
Or something not semen-related.
Haha
Of course you were, PA
lol
...I can't talk my way out of things.
hiya /ac/
Shoulda said it was the cake.
!lastseen "You shoulda said it was the cake/icing"

Well, what can I say. My mind went to the exact same place yoursdid, so we must be as bad as erach other
the cake is a lie, anyway
hey
Yeah but so's her excuse. :P
AFk on the phone.
iPal|WalkingxSpazztic, you come again soon, y'hear!
I propose a new corollary of Godwin's Law
a good thing to do is stop talking PA, check it out
Instead of references to Hitler, references to the cake being a lie.
El, that is never any fun. Then I woudl ahve no use for the shovels I keep especially for chats on kong
Wait wait wait
So Chazu's been feeding us LIES?!

Not always shiny, but very bright, yes.
i cant imagine how does it looks like...well i think its just fine

*sigh*
whyd u dump him?
u know takling bout love love love is really sound gay..
and they go over their problems with me like i'm some sort of relationship shrink
I'm female. *shrug*
Ah I know how ya feel there, Assasin. xD
Evening all.
iPal|Oh, I've been workin' on the Railroad! All the live long day! Slic3! Sing with me!
yo slice
It's an infinitely close-minded thing to say that love is "gay."
Hey.
2009-03-05 18:23:36 ElMicha: ive had that stuation before too assasian
*glomps Slic* HAHAH you have sickness on you :P
i'm like GOD stop telling me about your problems and relize how both of you are being stupid and fix it
*is glomped* Oh well.
kitty, thats mean
And Kat, I can top that.
I was only ever in a one month relationship back in high school, and yet I'm the "relationship guru" for all my friends.
brb getting some food
iPal|Good Bye, AssassinClan! Come back soon!
Hahhah yeah but you're cool.
Hah.
I'm a total nerd. xD
My longest relationship was 3 years, give or take.
Middle to high school.
I'm in another one now.
Mine was 2 1/2
Almost 10 months.
Congrats.
ive never had any...
How'd it end? And when?
Was that the one that you refered to as a ecent ending?
recent*
A month or so ago, and because he asked me about something I wasn't comfortable doing anymore...
I shoulda dumped him BEFORE I did all that stupid shit. *sigh*
...
Live and learn. No time for regrets.
Feel ok talking about what it was? A physical thing?
Not necessary if that's what you meant.
..... I really am tempted to throw out my camera because of it. May I leave it at that?
prolly a bj
oh
nudes
we can leave it there
I grasp the concept.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Nah, I don't regret any of the physical stuff, except that he didn't seem to be interested in kissing...
Was it good while it lasted?
oh this is insane
Most of the time. I felt so happy when I was around him...
give me a break
Hm.
Like I said, no time for regrets. It's tough, but just gotta pick yourself up and go.
can u guys get private , im trying not to read this
lol
On the plus side, when you're that much interested in a guy, cuddling is nearly orgasmic~
Dao, just mute the chat.
I'm tryin', Slic. xD
Mighty, then go to another room. Besides, "trying not to read it" is a stupid concept. No one is forcing you.
*yoda* There is no try, only do or do not. */yoda* XD
o0
and im trying to be cool
Well, you're failing.
*cracks up at Slic being Yoda*
i know, obviously
Ah, you're being "that guy"!
I'm totally yoda. I mean, I'm green, short, I've got a lightsaber, and I can totally do backflips.
Every chat room needs one.
Stay.
keep talking dont mind my bother;]
He he he - I was teasing.
well
is slice as wise as yoda?
I think we resolved everything we could. ;)
0o
*is confused by Dao*
so who was darth maul?
Maybe as wrinkly.
Darth Maul was *so* the man. That guy, seriously. He was awesome.
lol
yeah
I could be, I'm red enough after I accidently put dye in my conditioner~
but who was he?
At the end, he split in two to make two Darths.
Too bad neither Darth new what to do with itself besides flop into an abyss.
lmao
That's how he reproduces.
*knew
Darth was the emporor's padawan at the time
ahh
vader's successor
i see
No, no.
lol
Wrong series, Curu.
no?
i'm confuzzled
Darth Maul is Episode 1
yeah?
does he die?
He has Vader's place, then he dies and Vader later takes it
He was Palpatine's padawan when Anakin (future Vader) was like 6
lol
yeah
Vader never had a successor.
what am i gonna say? i cant relate to you topics
8.
i mean, as palpatines padawan
Anakin was 8.
lol
Or 9.
nvm
brb, gotta get some more noodles
iPal|curugulkano, when the candle is lit, the meal was cooked a long time ago.
No, Curu, he was Vader's predecessor as padawan.
Got disconnected. Drat.
He looked so little and cute as a kid, though.
back
noodles are posionous
I just wanted to hug him~
No! He was that horned guy. He was such a badass.
you talking about starwars now?
&lt;----- huge star wars geek.
So's my dad, Slic.
oh, i hate starwars
Darth Maul was my favorite Star Wars persona.
I like it, but I'm not a GEEK, perse.
how did i start a convo that lead up to this?
Just, gawd, an immense level of badassery. He was like a horned ninja.
lol
iPal|Webies, curugulkano!
bk
I've got a ton of star wars books back home
one thing i hate about the starwars is watching those sabers u calling
I have a bestiary. :D
What? You enjoy beastiality?
i meant predesessor\
those sounds are annoying
zing zing zing - saber
I had essential guide to characters, essential guide to ships, a bunch of extended universe stuff, etc
Bestiary, a book or compilation of papers detailing the lives, habititats, etc, of various animals.
Right, beastiality!
2009-03-05 18:35:12 Metaphysical: One can dream.
lulz
lol
(Sarcasm)
ok so who wants icecream
ah well
hey, what is so appealing about lesians?
All over our boies?!
bodies*
i mean, they're awesome, but what makes them so appealing?
lol
I MIGHT be willing to try furries, but NOT bestiality.
i realy need sleep, night people
Take care Micha.
Where do we begin?! "Lesians" totally do it for me.
I like lesbians~ :3
good night
sleep well
'Night.
Night night Mich
Furries, eh?
afk/sleeping
iPal|ElMicha, when the candle is lit, the meal was cooked a long time ago.
Not really into furries.
Chains and biting, though? Soooo hot. :3

Pass. :-/
Not so much into BSDM.
I don't bite, I like being bitten. :P
Or at all, rather.
Yeah, I'm not a big fan of sadism.
what does bsdm stand for
?
*shrug* Your loss
square root of 1,000,000
Hell if I know. It just refers to that bondage/roleplay/dark kinky stuff.
Bondage, sadomasochism, and uh...
Time to go buy booze, it's 40's night again!
ahh
brb, buying 40's for some epic drinking.
iPal|FREEEEEEEEEEDOOOOOM! Say it with me, Slic3! FREEEEEEEEDOOOOOM!
lol
Pffft I'm not so much into the roleplay or the dark. I just like being chained up. xD
It might be BSMD.
here we go again
I got my ex to chain me up for a while, one time, soooo kinky. xP
That's actually something I'm not *unwilling* to try.
The chains or the 40's?
im listening
huh
lol
I'm more so for the "taking a break and letting someone else do the work" part of being bound, rather than the "being unable to move or escape as an erotic tool".
But I'd rather have a bound partner.
please
dao, there are other rooms. you know
;] i said dont mind me..
even though roads is the superior
For me its the being bound, not the work. I mean, I've never really TESTED it, but....
He said he's listening, didn't you see? He's at full attention.
pretend im a shodow
But...?
ahh
lol
Shadow not shodow. *bops with newspaper*
misunderstanding
dont mind the spell, just read
ooh, bop him again, that was funny
*bops again*
the look on his face...
lol
Heheh it's fun. Wanna try? *hands newspaper*
wish i had a camera
why do i always look funny
lol
I'm going to break godwin's law.
Kitty is infact, a spelling Nazi.
'cuz you're you, Dao.
the almighty newspaper?
in real life, and give ma break even here
am i worthy?
"In fact." It's 2 words.
Bleh, I was wrong.
iPal|Welcome Back, Slic3!
2009-03-05 18:41:54 Slic3: Not going to buy boozes yet.

*bops doa*
Wrong kid of nazi

That's what she said?

I said it was fun, but general gist.

Oh, I'll take it!
Can I piss on said newspaper?
*tosses to meta*
*Reads it*

lol
hey phillies
biether of you are worthy
Woah, Meta, you can read erman?
*German
Ah. How positively refreshing! Look at all these news stories!
Ooo!
I can pretend to.
lol
Alright, I'm done with it.
PHILLIES, U THERE?
I'm going to leave it in the toilet.
Next to it, that is.
*hits*
You know, bathroom reading.
Oh.... sorry
lol
-_-
its not on the trend anymore
to pretend to read some more later?
u watch tv while on the bathroom
Absolutely. The bathroom is a reading sanctuary.
I don't. 0o
PHILLIES 272!!!!!!!
WTF who watches TV in the loo?
Seriously. 0o
say i
i
me
I'd love to!
0o WEIRDOS
i wish i had a tv in my bathroom
Gotta have something to do while you're sitting there.
i depends, if ur cool ur cool with it
*yawn* i is sleepy now
iPal|AssassinClan, I've been... Expecting you.
C YA PHILLIES, HAVE TO TAKE A SHOWER
Seriously, I'd set up my computer there, get a mini fridge, hook it the TV to HBO, and live there.
I'm a nerd and proud of it~
That's perfect.
THanks for broadcasting that.
lmao
i'd jook an xbox up to it
hook*
But I would NOT want a tv in my baffroom
I'm not much of a console gamer.
being constapated would have a whole new meaning
i even eat's pizza while sitting
My computer is a beast, though.
in the bathroom
mines not
I hate consoles, I love the desktop I built though.
Being called a beast in bed is actually an insult, ya know. xD
lol
it is?
how so?
Pa-shaw.
Elaborate.
Meta, what're you running in your comp?
Humans are the only ones that get so creative etc with sex. Beasts only ever do it one way.
Unless it's a hair joke.
ahh
No joke, Meta. :D
*enlightened*
kitty u need to have a boyfriend already
It was top of the line a year or so ago, but I can tell you the general specs.
Why, Dao?
I built mine about 10 months ago
What it sounds like she needs is a living dildo. ;)
O.O
XD
0o...
Ohai Spazz.
lmfao
Always at the strangest times. >.>;
Throw me some general specs, Meta.
i love kong
Hi Slic.
i dont know, hard to say
*sough* No thank you, Meta.
xD
Spazzz
*cough
Takumiiii.
get on, kill some bunnies, and talk about stuff like thius
Spaaaazzzz
Taaakumiiiiii.
Hi.
8800 GTS 640MB @ 1000/650, 3GB Mem @ 1066, 2.13 Dual Core overclocked to 2.4.
..Hah! You have more consonents! I wi--oh. Hi.
I'd rather a guy to make out with. >.&lt;
no were not talking geek huh
Just try kissing a peach.
1. I hate peaches 2. EW
That's what they did on The Pick-Up Artist!
You've got me beat in RAM and Gfx, but I've got a beast processor to make up for it.
Oh, yeah? What is it?
I'm rocking an 8800GT 512MB, 2GB mem, and a 2.4 GHZ Quad Core (no OC)
Ah, Quad.
That's something. It certainly is.
Aye. I &lt;3 my quad core.
How much did the processor run you?
if it was my birthday, id prefer your gifts would b appreciated if its PIzz
a
Once I hit something I can't run exceedingly well, I'll just drop in more RAM and another GFX card for SLI
Meta, I got it from Newegg, wish I could remember how much but I want to say something like $275 shipped
<3 Newegg.
Nice.
I <3 Newegg.
I got my EVGA 9600 of Newegg.
Hm. Wait, my heart isn't showing up.
Anyway, I love Newegg.
Meta, do &lt and add a semicolon after the t
That'll give you the &lt;
OH.
<
I've been wanting to upgrade my cores, but I'd have to get a new Motherboard, and that's a pain in the ass.
waw..its really to relate when ur not trend to the advacnce tech
So do &lt3 but add a semicolon between the t and the 3
I took that as literal, and was wondering what that meant. x.x
hard to relate
2009-03-05 18:52:38 Slic3: Meta, I'm rocking an ASUS Striker Extreme
&lt;3
Hm. That'll do. ^_^
I built this system from the bottom up
I've definitely got to think about upgrading as I head off to college.
Senior year, now.
Ah, see, there's the difference. I'm in college already.
...*1. Has a Mac, and 2. Does not know that much about her computer* x.x So I'm just going to shut up.
= O
Spazz has a mac? SHUNNAAAA!
Macs?
OMG I'm not the only mac lover here :D
SHUN THE NONBELIEVER!
.-.
Bleah.
*glomps Spazz*
I'm a graphic desigher.
2009-03-05 18:53:37 Slic3: Fair 'nuff, Spazz.
well im onley staring at this text
Hah. I'm with the shunning, too!
It works better for m--*Flaail*
.. macs work better than pcs
BUTBUT.
Erm...
It works best with the Adobe programs,
and all of the other stuff I use it for most.
If everything on a Mac "Just Works," why do they even have a Support office?
its hard to catch up, so il just shut up
People always use that argument. But if you're an intelligent user, windows is fine. I've NEVER gotten a BSOD in just under a year with this computer, and I can blow alot of comps out of the water.
That said, Macs are top of the line for graphics editing.
Exactly.
Computer Talk time
You can get a PC to that level, but a Mac is usually more efficient for less money.
My Dad's a comp programmer, he hates windows.
And I just don't like the visual...appearance of Windows. It makes me feel cooperate.
and im shutting up
Macs are the newbie's PC or the digital artist's studio. Between those two, get a PC.
Spazz, my windows looks nothing like standard windows.
I've customized the hell out of my theme.
Oh, same.
I sometimes miss my linux days, though.
Hah. All I remember fondly of Linux was the penguin with the eyes that'd follow your mouse.
Ubuntu was nice, if not convoluted as hell at times.
Meta, I can work a PC perfectly fine. But I prefer Macs because they better fit my needs, seeing as the Adobe products are so much better on Macs, etc.
Is there anyway how to DEFAULT game to the original settings?
Yeah, I agree. Macs certainly have an appeal to an artist.
I've never had issues running Adobe products on my PC, but my PC isn't exactly a PC so much as it's a custom-built-to-spec machine.
*Shrug* Maybe it's because I've used Macs my whole life, but the way it's visually set up makes so much more sense to me.
There should be a "Default" button. Depends on the game.
See, I've run windows all my life, Spazz.
I remember the days of the DOS prompt, and Windows 3.11 being a program, not an OS.
And there is where the fundamental argument rests. :p
There's a plethora of PC products to make the PC feel just like a Mac.
...I miss DOS.
You could do ANYTHING with DOS.
RocketDock, for one, which I'm using now.
Now it's just a piece of shit emulator.
Well I know that, Meta,
*has no clue what's going on*
same
but why would you want Mac products produced for your PC if you didn't feel that they were reliable and ...good.
I just feel that PCs are fundamentally better in terms of technical specs and developed support.
Like having Microsoft Office for Macs.
cant catch up, not geek here,wel
*won't touch a mac with a 10 foot pole*
Why does it matter if you have a 10 foot pole, Slic?
Macs lacked initially a good Office app set, so M.O. mae a product for Macs.
*has been watching Demitri martin*
I don't want to get "the mac" on me. ^_^
.-.
To each their own.
Nah, I just don't enjoy the "Mac Experience", really.
Agreed
It's too...odd.
Hah. "Mac Experience." That's good, heh.
What is the difference between a mac and a pc?
.-.
AGH OH MY ****ING GODS D:!
That's what I've been saying all along, Meta.
Alot, AC.
*gasp
a pc can do everything a mac can't
XD
And visa versa.
2009-03-05 18:59:45 Slic3: What'd you do, Kat?
Hot Coffee, meatboy.... Q.Q
The operating system, as well as the technology inside the actual computer in many cases.
They copy off each other to compensate for previous lacks. It's the wonder of a capitalist materialistic society.
I don't enjoy the OS, that's all.
Bleh, that was just lame, Kat. I remember watching it.
ok who wants to play basketball
*shudder*
And I'm not a big fan of the company, in itself.
So.... EW
i can almost dunk with my height 57
Woohoo! Time to go buy boozes!
brb buying 40's and drinking with roommate and friends.
iPal|We know why you're leaving us, Slic3, and we are sad.
Not like an alternative of socialist stagnation or anarchy is a better alternative.
:-/
Didn't say capitalism was bad.
Seems to get a bad rep.
It has its downfalls.
like every governmental system.
Without a doubt.
If it weren't for ****ing human flaw, communism might not be as bad as its reputation dictates.
Deus Ex.
hello again my fellow persons
ZOMG
iPal|Ah, Slic3, my loyal servant. Hello.
Deus EX
Excellent game.
One of the endings - SPOILER - has you merge with an AI to create the perfect system of government; the AI is integrated with all forms of technology, allowing it to be an efficient benevolent dictator.
Did not really enjoy the sequel, however.
Absolutely.
I liked the '98 Windows...
Oh, yeah.
The "sequel" was a downgrade.
Don't be so polite to it.
The sequel was shit.
Well, you said it for me. ;)
They're making a third.
Prequel.
*hopes it'll be more like the first*
Eh, it's iffy.
if people actually thought that a CEO and a janitor should be paid the same then yeah communism would work
I want lost planet 2
They retained no area-based damage, but now there's health regen, and the stats are probably going to be a little edited to appeal to the "modern gamer," who is apparently half as intelligent as one during the time of Deus Ex.
Bleh.
OMG Kirby lays eggs?!
The Deus Ex advancement was perfect.
were playing games  and wer talking games.. how boring is that?
Even if you could totally get a ton of extra XP on the first stage if you just wandered around after everything was cleared.
Yeah - that's how I played it. I never did the sneak/slaughter/etc. path. I pretty much always did all thee.
I feel confident in saying I think I explored pretty much all the areas almost exhaustivly.
Yeah.
Okay, actually going to buy booze for real this time.
Later all.
dao, i agreed with you about the sex talk, and the tech babbling... but bitching about gamers talking about a game, on a gamer site... now thats just bitching...
brb, buying 40's and dranking
iPal|Slic3, you come again soon, y'hear!
lol dranking
oh am i, well its rude
Why?
See ya.
So, next topic?

iPal|Good Bye, Kittykatk8! Come back soon!

ok?
....with xtra cheese?
fluffster, bitching is gay..
did you just call yourself gay?
well i cant argue with u coz u had the point  back there, but im not gay thou
sorry dao. to me gay is a sexual preference, not an insult...
so hus gay
Ditto to fluff
iPal|Kittykatk8, I've been... Expecting you.
*raises hand* I'm half.
hey i'm gay but in the happy sense
please
well those people are funny thou
thats what good about them
Ahhh lol
Bitch attack, brb
if u call a man bitch, hes gay
Sorry, Lily stepped on me. xD
Nonsense, caling a man a bitch is funny, not calling him gay. xD
its awkward thou
son of a b** wud do
that insult really loses its sting after youre mum manages to call you that, dao....
well it never happens here
im guessing youre mum isnt irish, then..
we never used to say bad words
Heheheh
*cricket*
or else 12hours cermon wuld do
0o
2009-03-05 19:20:01 MightyDao: i do say suc* thou , to my friend
yea,, and i dont..il loose my allowance and get grounded
no literatly 12hours
What religion are you? 0o
Mormon?
its an experession
roman catholic
Riiight. no note needed; I already try to stay away from catholics.
xD
how come
i think thats why babes like u at your place..always have many bfs...they dont have values for
..... They don't tend to look favorably on blasphemous vegetarian democratic girls with neon red hair...
it depends obviously
*cracks up* Many bfs! HAH!
Oh yeah, the fact I like girls also tends to strain the relationship somewhat!
try having someone with you..that is catholic.well someone who can depend on GOd...and ull see what am i talking
Wait are you saying I'm a slut, or that I'm lucky? 0o
no? and its funny
But still, you think I'll have alot of bfs? *cracks up again*
except for the vegetarian part you sound like most of my girlfriends Kat... and I guess the hair color. My wife has neon pink hair
its in the personality not in the religion
catholic people...have more values to anything
Yes, but still. I haven't a chance of gettin a bf at the moment, and I've only ever had one.
I don't really want a bf at the moment, though, so it's just as well. *shrug*
catholic people have a tendency to be more uptight about everything than most other groups.......
2009-03-05 19:26:24 Kittykatk8: *D:
if a guys u meet up and doesnt kisses you for a week of dating then...he has values
I say this  as a lapsed one, mind you...
yet they still like to indulge in what there not supposed to
Pffft I had a bf for 2 1/2 years, he NEVER tried to kiss me. NEVER. ._.
everyone does lol
hes insane
or he is anal and his stuck up mum taught hima bit to well, dao.... its all in the perspective...
Back. Did I miss anything?
my experience is that catholics tend to REALLY distrust anything different from them
how can u call him bf
2009-03-05 19:27:29 nubbs: porn gets better buisiness in areas that in the open tend to sy amore about how bad it is
no its not
Well, we did some other messing around, remember what I told ya, Dao?
what, i dont think so
Plus I was crazy in love with him at the time.... I still miss him, but... I don't wanna go back to how I was...
Awww - I didn't hear anything about messing around.
Yes you did.
The chains n camera, remember?
I must have missed something after all.
ah please
chains and camera kinky
Don't ask, I don't do that anymore.
Well, the chains I do, but not the camera.
nasty girls ar fogivable...guys with values can change them
I have values. I just also happen to like sex. *shrug*
screw values those are the fun one
Oh, that's bullcrap. "Values"?
Values in your context mean conservatism.
not exactly
I have my own beliefs, my values are different.
Exactly.
*is polytheistic*
Did you know the greeks had religious orgys?
So, by my religion, I'm really doing nothing wrong by enjoying sex~
=O really???
i am considerd an a hole to some people at work cus my values
Yarly
It's foolish to assume that "values" hold the same meaning to everyone, and it's even more ignorant to think that someone *lacks* values because they do not share your definition of the word.
i said some guy deserved what he got cus he was drunk and ran into the back of a semi and died
You might really just be an asshole. I dunno, nubbs. xD
..
...
0o
wu
kik
kik
;p;
Drunk drivers. Hard to say. One of those "situations."
lol
if your stuppid enough to drink and drive you aint helpin the world anyway
Oh boy
values are just people's opinions of what they think is right and wrong and then as more people agree to it they become the main ones and then everyone thinks people with different values are evil or bad
oh boy oh boy oh boy
Oh hey McK~
....
STOP THROWING LOGICAL FALLICIES AT EACH OTHER
but my ring tone is denise leary's your an asshole
AFK, reading the new Johnny Wanderer
iPal|We know why you're leaving us, McKain, and we are sad.
I think I have a catholic either hitting on me or telling me I'm going to hell, and I can't figure out which.
i think hell is more fun
I think it's both - he's using the "I'll be your savior" line.
lol
i think it's funny listening to those religious people
heaven is where all the good peope go
the last pope abolisehd hell, apparently its now just differing levels of purgatory..
ad pepole tend to be the fun oned
baf
...abolished
Well, my religion is absolute blasphemy to his, and I'm not willing to change for him. Besides, he's not my type. xD
It's a logical factuality; morality is a publically agreed upon set of morals.
espescially the ones that come on the bus and try to make me say a pray so i can go to heaven
It's not an "indoctrinated" sense of right and wrong.
i perfer catholic,but really i have no preference
Honestly, I think too slowly to point all all the falicies you're using
iPal|Oh, I've been workin' on the Railroad! All the live long day! McKain! Sing with me!
It stems for Catholicism for the most part.
but you're using a lot of them
now stop it,
speechless
Hehe... Phallicies..
Heheh
mck you hurt my brain O.o
Sounds like you're unappreciative of the likes of Nietzsche.
That's his concept.
Ahhh ow
http://www.johnnywander.com/node/149
cathlics say there the more open religon but it seems like they try to convert everyone
what didyou do now kitty?
lulz
Johnny Wanderer is hilarious
2009-03-05 19:35:57 niper395: and that hurtlol?
It's an excellent point, there; there is no morality - it's just a set of socially accepted rules established by those in power to control the masses.
Yeah, my throat is all torn up from coughing. >.<
And by what do you base your claims, Meta?
thats right...strp....
No, just a virus.
*strep*
It doesn't help that I had cheese for snack.... xD
lol
1 person with values vs 1billion people not at all, outstanding
I'm explaing to you the Nietzschean train of thought.
i'vehadacold forforever
DAMN THIS SPACE BAR!!!!
strep throat means you got a flesh eating bacteria in your throat! YAY! :D
I mean, what's the opposing view? What is morality if not exactly that?
I know how ya feel. Mine's only been a few days, but OW.
You're assuming morals are in place with the intent to control
*is bored of religion*
yeah i got that cough that makesthat nasty slime comeup
2009-03-05 19:38:15 niper395: yeah lol

?about?
that's right
fortunately, our veins can't cough
as far as I know
Or CAN they?!
~gasp~
lol
coughing veinslol
OUR VEINS WILL RISE UP AND ASSUALT US
Morals *are* in existance to control - if not control others, then to control oneself.
EEEEEEEEEEK
=O!!!
By way of restraint, that is.
hi
*pokes Dao* So WERE you hitting on me, or just dcondemning me?
It's "morality" that keeps one from engaging their impulses, be they, say, violent, carnal, ect.
veins control the world.....its a well know fact.....
no, im trying to stop..
but they'r d ones hus making a big issue
I wanna know, and I'll keep bugging you 'till ya tell. :D
i dont wona argue
Honestly, when it comes to morals, all I like to know is there's a reason for them
Surely, there is, or they wouldn't exist.
I'd make a poor philosopher ^^

Just a heads up, never buy a bike with "ninja" or "katana" in the name...they're utter crap.
lol
how so?
Shoddy manufacturing, piece of shit bikes in general.
Ah, okiedoke. I'll be goin' then. Hasta luego.
Later silv
ahh
I hate graphics....
Whyzat, Mck?
Just not my cup of tea
i don't like tea
hey mck
ipal should have an I counter
lol
icounter?
yeah
like, who's sick?
and it counts how many people say i
you could say !count
is that plausible?
My nose hairs are greying
sure, but I don't see the point =p
lol
it'd be handy
or maybe not
lol
just an idea
brb, need some more noodles
iPal|FREEEEEEEEEEDOOOOOM! Say it with me, curugulkano! FREEEEEEEEDOOOOOM!
Ahhh
how do you kill the cerberus?
~shoot its butt
ok
xD
~ok i'm going to be playing Touhou 10.5 naow...
have fun
Enjoy
~hope i get a good gameplay to show to you guys ^.^
*has no idea what Touhou 10.5 is*
~want me to show my past vids on it?
maybe its just that !count would just be one more aspect of iPal to abuse\
iPal|Ah, curugulkano, my loyal servant. Hello.
lol
Quite likely
Just tell me what sort of game it is, Scarlet
Bullet hell, SLic
like Frantic
only hellier
I just don't see how it would be useful, curu
oh, the voice in my head corrects me
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAny4N4Kh4Y
it's a fighter
~the fighting game
with Touhou characters
What is Touhou?
An anime?
~"a game series
Ah, okay.
~"about a bunch of lolis flying through the skies, shooting each other down with walls of bullets"
Oh crap gotta kill zombies brb later
~by internet stupidity definition ^.^
Touhou sounds amazing.
http://www.k2.dion.ne.jp/~michiiyu/i_316.jpg
~a pic with all the characters...
~throughout all 12 + 2 games ^.^
O_O
That's an insane number of characters.
~yup...
HOLY SHIT
And it sounds gloriously violent.
I may have to play it.
:D
seriously, Aoi?
~and the guy is coming up with game 12
~seriously what?
I don't even understand how people develop that many characters
so whats the point of iPal logging chat?
~i'm doing the same thing at the moment...
It just doesn't compute in my brain
~i've come up with at least 40 characters for my fantasy world
~fails at creativity~
Awesome!
iPal|Webies, Namino!
curu, it's a chat bot =p
I have hundreds across my various story worlds. :)
~i've molded possibly 10 near complete stories and have a blueprint for 20 others
logging the chat is a minor part of it
._.
I hate you
BUT
you should put them on Sybil =DD
I've figured out updating my story without complete reposts!
Give my.... 1... maybe 3.... users something to read
For a small update..
~lol
http://www.fictionpress.com/s/2634070/1/War
so what's the big part of it?
~well... i could try... but i'm still making bonds between characters, which is what i'm aiming for
abuse of iPal?
!lastseen Queentakesrook
McKain, I saw Queentakesrook 11 hours ago
is the biggest feature
~i wonder...
Ooh, Namino, first thing - be careful with past historic and past imperfect.
AoiScarlet|!lastseen McKain
AoiScarlet, McKain spoke 16 seconds ago
~that's.... awesome XD
?
Dude! You just completed the Let's Abuse iPal challenge in Road Scholars and won the You Suck badge and 5 points!
~the possibilities of abuse has risen
Kongratulations, chiryoushi!
ahh
oh hey, McKain, you're here, kool
*preens*
I just wanted to mention, I like what you did with iPal, especially the brb stuff. I lol'd quite a bit at the Stargate quote
I'm not concerned with eliminating abuse so much as making it not fun
=o!
I am so happy someone got that XD
which one was tha?t
hehe well, I am quite a fan.
when you understand the fire is hot, the meal was cooked a long time ago
erm, close to that, anyway, i dont think that's quite it
or if the candle is lit
ahh, right
I don't recall correctly
ahh
lool
i wondered about that
I'm going to go play some CrossFire
>.<
~=.=* hate against him rising...
~as if it's not enough that he's probably going to quit on me when i land the death ring spell card on him
Ookay, sounds like it's gonna be awesome funs. :)
*scowl*

sherweet
imma go to bed
bey, all
bye
~bywe then
T'raa. ^^
can someone go play The Darkness Project
I want to do multiplayer
man i was late to class today and i figured out how to do all the stuff i missed in like 30 seconds
What class was that?
i really think the school placement test is stupid aoi
math
~XD
easy algebra stuff
lol algebra is easy
i swear everything i have to do homework for and we do in class is so easy i can do it in my sleep
wait till college
it gets harder
~we're both in college...
i really think that test is stupid
I failed my algebra placement test:(
ouch
I am about done with math 60 though
~heck College Alegrebra is too easy... it's just that the teacher gives 100 problems a day...
placement test put me in easy math
Math 60 is SUPER easy
~placement test put me in Trigonometry
and by the looks of it your math looks easy also aoi
~but i need college algebra to transfer
The only thing I had to think about doing was word problems
i'm in math 70 and no idea why i'm not at least in 101
even word problems are easy
~physics sucks... it's like regular algebra, but with only word problem
i was in math 105 and math 165
yeah try ap physics
~no thank you ^.^
anything with math is easy but it's a matter of wheither i want to do the work
ap physics? you mean playing pool?
i could have done calculus
but the previous teacher said i couldn't cause i wasn't doing good in the class
unfourtantly no pool
physics wasn't as bad as engineering math
I got a B with a 76% in German.
i tried calc thats math 165 in college but i failed it
just cause i never needed to write out the problems
and for my magor i got to get to at least calc 3
the h trig and mu gave me headaches at first
or 4
math is easy but the people who teach it keep forcing me to write out the stupid problems when i don't need to
exactly
yeah, I always hated showing all steps
same here
I used to get 3/10 on perfect assignments because of that
high school math up to trig was so easy i never went to class and i still passed all my classes
its retarted to do it if u dont need to
Assassin, and others, it's so that others can make sure you've done it right.
pissed me off
And that you aren't just copying answers.
felt like I was writing things out so any retard could follow, and it still wasn't enough
no, Namino, people WOULD copy answers, so that they had all the steps listed
i don't are if they can tell if i did it right i know i did it right and i was a lober kind of in high school and so it's not like i could copy anyone's homework
~OMFGA
~that danged magic bunny!
magic... bunny?
Now me, I do the bare minimum, but turn in my test first. With all correct answers and first in, I can't have cheated.
you shoot the magic bullets back at him?
Couldn't do it, eh Scarlet?
~i have only the pistol!
so?
~and teh barkeep with a pistol
~my arm hurts
oh, haha
aoi, no problem
~dangit!
back in my day we only had rocks
I did up to 46 with only the colt
~it didn't give me enough cash to get an SMG
shoot his magic like hell
~im on wave 20 with only a maxed out cult
~and this is hellishly fun ^.^
yeah, 20's still easy
still easy
wait for the sniper rifle
sheer awesomeness
just keep shooting his magic bullet till it hits his shield
forget the minigun, the sniper rifle's where it's at
~well... i've been wasting cash at upgrades ^.^
i like the mini just for when the rage hits
scavengers?
yeah, mini's great with rage
~just to increase the difficulty... since i cant afford a better gun...
but sniper rifle's like permanent rage
Scavengers and Partner are the best upgrades.
i mean in secs with mini everything on te field is dead
Sniper is too slow, mini doesn't hit enough enemies.
Grenade launcher, and normal grenades, that's the ownage.
sniper bullets go through enemies
it's like permanent rage
~Colt 45 is where it's all at ^.^
it is not too slow
Explosives are amazing.
Colt 45 got me to wave 46, yeah
plus the sniper has to reload
after there, Colt 45 is where it is not at
sniper rifle = permanent rage
reload is a non issue
end boss for bunnies is the easiest crap ever
spam grenade and minigun
hell yeah it is when they are all over the front of the bar
mini or the grenade launcher
with the sniper rifle, they never got close
mini and rage is fun, though
you should be able to buy more than 20 grenades per wave, and just go nuts
had to replay to get those badges
although i used colt and then used mini as clean up even til the end
~screw it! i'm grenade rushing!
thats why i dont have my last medal, i didnt buy grenades till lvl 59 and that was just to waste money
~SPATA!!!
DEagle was my weapon of choice.
i got bored and bought all upgrades, all weapons, and then upgraded every weapon
I was thinking about DEagle
Bubble Tanks 2 is a bitch.
but went straight from Colt to Sniper
lol
yeah it is
Bubble Tanks 2 is great, but tedious
especially when you get knocked down a tank size to the point where you have to go recollect on small crap
I particularly hate the way it plays like someone's got a little slider that affects the passage of time, and keeps twiddling it up and down.
brb
?
never had those issues
slow computer?
iPal|FREEEEEEEEEEDOOOOOM! Say it with me, chiryoushi! FREEEEEEEEDOOOOOM!
~sweet colt+genade combo ftw
~*grenade
Gah.  How long does it take to get the final Addiction medal?
2.5 hours?
something like that?
Eesh.
just ignore the game and chat
or sleep
Well, time to let it run in the background.
Lol
~lol
Exactly.
Though I do still need to get the final kills medal.
>.>
Wave 56 is your best friend
